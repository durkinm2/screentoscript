# screentoscript
A javascript tool to parse film screenplays on http://www.imsdb.com/.
Also interested in seeing if I can compare script dialogue to subtitles downloaded from [OpenSubtitles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opensubtitles-api).  

todo:
- update regex's
- find a script that isn't compatible with current method of finding pre to start
- can't assume script starts after int or ext
- fix misc from becoming action (matrix)
- check for parenthetical in misc, see feast l. 82
