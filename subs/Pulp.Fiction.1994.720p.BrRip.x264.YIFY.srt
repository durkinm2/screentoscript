1
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:32,927
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:36,460
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,473
"L'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

4
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,032
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,511
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,673
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

7
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:48,910
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:52,011
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:55,546
- Quack, quack, quack. - Take heart,
'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again.

10
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:59,117
Since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna have to hear me quack.

11
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:03,928
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,833
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!

13
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:11,198
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:14,368
I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:17,242
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:17,313 --> 00:01:19,372
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

17
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:22,475
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:22,552 --> 00:01:26,784
They're insured. Why should they give a fuck?
I don't even need a gun in a Federal bank.

19
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:30,314
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:33,362
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:36,990
"We got this guy's little girl. If you don't give
him all your money, we're gonna kill her."

22
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:39,864
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.

23
00:01:39,936 --> 00:01:45,772
Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone.
Not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

24
00:01:45,842 --> 00:01:50,472
- Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl?

25
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:54,243
There probably never was a little girl.
The point of the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:57,309
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:57,387 --> 00:02:00,356
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

28
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:02,857
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.

29
00:02:02,925 --> 00:02:07,089
- No more liquor stores? - What've we been
talkin' about? Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:10,132
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.

31
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,133
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

32
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:14,567
You tell 'em empty out the register,
they don't know what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:16,571
They make it too personal.

34
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,871
- We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna
make us kill him. - I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:25,243
I don't want to either. But they'll probably
put us in a situation where it's us or them.

36
00:02:25,314 --> 00:02:27,248
And if it's not the gooks,

37
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:29,944
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

38
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:34,456
You got Grandpa lrving sitting behind the
counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

39
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:36,458
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

40
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:38,460
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.

41
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:41,463
- We're out of it.
- Well, what then, day jobs?

42
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:43,556
- Not in this life.
- What then?

43
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:47,930
Garçon, coffee!

44
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:50,302
This place.

45
00:02:51,774 --> 00:02:54,868
Garçon means boy.

46
00:02:58,114 --> 00:03:00,776
This place?
A coffee shop?

47
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,819
What's wrong with that?

48
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:07,549
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

49
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:10,958
Bars, liquor stores,

50
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:14,758
gas stations; you get your head
blown off stickin' up one of them.

51
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:18,494
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

52
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:22,265
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

53
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:26,832
- I bet you could cut down on the hero
factor in a place like this. - Correct.

54
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:30,174
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

55
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:32,612
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.

56
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:35,515
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

57
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:39,544
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.
No way they're takin' a bullet for the register.

58
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:42,557
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour...

59
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,150
really give a fuck
you're stealin' from the owner?

60
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:48,322
Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths,
they don't know what's goin' on.

61
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:53,061
One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet,
the next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.

62
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:58,198
See, I got the idea the last
liquor store we stuck up, remember?

63
00:03:58,274 --> 00:04:00,970
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:04,877
You got the idea of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

65
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:08,348
- Thank you. - Made more from the
wallets than we did from the register.

66
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:10,715
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.

67
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:14,449
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?

68
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:16,549
Pretty smart.

69
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:21,120
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

70
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:25,691
- Come on.
- All right. Same as last time, remember?

71
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:28,532
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.

72
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:36,883
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

73
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:40,580
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

74
00:04:40,658 --> 00:04:43,525
Any of you fucking pricks move,

75
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:47,499
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

76
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:47,828
And I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

77
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,240
- Jungle boogie
- Get down with the boogie

78
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:43,473
- Jungle boogie
- Get it on

79
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:45,743
- Jungle boogie
- Get down with the boogie

80
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:48,047
- Jungle boogie
- Get it on

81
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,383
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the boogie

82
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:52,514
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the get down

83
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,888
- Jungle boogie
- Get down and boogie

84
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,122
- Jungle boogie
- Shake it around

85
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:08,982
- Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.
- Okay, what you want to know?

86
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:11,890
- Hash is legal there, right?
- It's legal, but it ain't 100 % legal.

87
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,590
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

88
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:19,997
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.

89
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:22,730
- Those are hash bars?
- Yeah. It breaks down like this.

90
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:25,136
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

91
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:28,403
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

92
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:32,879
It's illegal to carry it, but-but that doesn't matter,
'cause get a load of this.

93
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:37,407
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,
it's illegal for them to search you.

94
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:41,421
- I mean, that's a right the cops in
Amsterdam don't have. - Oh, man! I'm goin'.

95
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:44,014
That's all there is to it.
I'm fuckin' goin'.

96
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:47,027
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.

97
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:49,825
- But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
- What?

98
00:07:49,898 --> 00:07:53,834
It's the little differences. I mean,
they got the same shit over there that they got here,

99
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:57,463
- but it's just there, it's a little different.
- Example.

100
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,667
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

101
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:04,371
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

102
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:08,279
And in Paris, you can buy a beer in McDonald's.
You know what they call...

103
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:11,841
a Quarter-Pounder
with Cheese in Paris?

104
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,115
They don't call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?

105
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:16,987
They got the metric system.
They wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter-Pounder is.

106
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:20,960
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.

107
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:22,496
- Royale with Cheese.
- That's right.

108
00:08:22,564 --> 00:08:24,498
What do they call a Big Mac?

109
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:27,865
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.

110
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:31,064
Le Big Mac.

111
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,303
- What do they call a Whopper?
- I don't know. I didn't go into Burger King.

112
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:38,812
- You know what they put on French fries
in Holland instead of ketchup? - What?

113
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,872
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

114
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,250
- I seen 'em do it, man.
They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit. - Yuck.

115
00:08:48,923 --> 00:08:52,222
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

116
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:57,960
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

117
00:08:58,032 --> 00:09:01,627
- That's countin' our guy?
- Not sure.

118
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:05,104
- So that means that it could be up
to five guys up there? - It's possible.

119
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,539
We should have
fuckin' shotguns.

120
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:10,271
- What's her name?
- Mia.

121
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:14,543
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
- I don't know.

122
00:09:14,616 --> 00:09:18,211
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.

123
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:20,777
Oh, really?
She do anything I'd have seen?

124
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:25,292
- I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.
- Pilot? What's a pilot?

125
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,887
- Well, you know the shows on TV?
- I don't watch TV.

126
00:09:28,963 --> 00:09:32,592
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television,

127
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:35,761
- and on this invention they show shows, right?
- Yeah.

128
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:40,240
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.

129
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:43,243
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

130
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:46,246
and on the strength of that one show,
they decide if they wanna make more shows.

131
00:09:46,314 --> 00:09:50,842
Some get chosen and become television programs.
Some don't, become nothin'.

132
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:54,115
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

133
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:56,952
You remember
Antwan Rockamora?

134
00:09:57,025 --> 00:10:00,859
Half-black, half-Samoan.
Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."

135
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:04,329
- Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
- I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat.

136
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,232
I mean, he got a weight problem.
What's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

137
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:11,739
- I think I know who you mean. What about him?
- Marsellus fucked him up good.

138
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:16,038
Word 'round the campfire is it was on
account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

139
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:28,212
- So what he'd do? Fuck her?
- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

140
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:31,986
- Well, then what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.

141
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:36,492
A foot massage?

142
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:38,623
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,634
Then what'd Marsellus do?

144
00:10:40,702 --> 00:10:43,865
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.

145
00:10:43,938 --> 00:10:47,874
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.

146
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:52,003
He had a little garden down at the bottom
enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.

147
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,344
Nigger fell through that.

148
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:57,350
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

149
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,550
- That's a damn shame.
- Hmm.

150
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,060
- But still, you play with matches, you get burned.
- What do you mean?

151
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:14,295
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage.

152
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:16,837
You don't think he overreacted?

153
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:21,773
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.

154
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:26,007
It was a foot massage. A foot massage is nothin'.
I give my mother a foot massage.

155
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,607
It's laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus's new wife.

156
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:34,587
I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out?
No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.

157
00:11:34,655 --> 00:11:36,748
Whoa, stop right there.
Eatin' the bitch out...

158
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:39,418
and givin' the bitch a foot massage
ain't even the same fucking thing.

159
00:11:39,494 --> 00:11:43,430
- It's not. It's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

160
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:46,433
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

161
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:50,267
But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking
your tongue in the holiest of holies...

162
00:11:50,338 --> 00:11:54,604
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;
it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

163
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:58,543
- Foot massages don't mean shit!
- Have you ever given a foot massage?

164
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:01,707
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.

165
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:04,445
- I'm the foot fuckin' master.
- You given a lot of them?

166
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,751
Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and everything.
I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

167
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:11,485
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

168
00:12:12,894 --> 00:12:15,590
Fuck you.

169
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:18,757
- You give 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

170
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:22,098
- You know, I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage. - Yo, yo, yo, man.

171
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,367
You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

172
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:29,001
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.

173
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:34,407
What time you got?

174
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:36,609
7:22 in the a.m.

175
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:40,245
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

176
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:51,595
Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man
a foot massage don't make it right...

177
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,863
for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a
building into a glass motherfuckin' house,

178
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:57,666
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;
that shit ain't right.

179
00:12:57,738 --> 00:13:01,970
Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better
paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.

180
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:07,003
I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a
massage don't mean nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

181
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:11,711
Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.

182
00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:15,517
We act like they don't, but they do.
That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.

183
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,683
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...

184
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:20,989
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.

185
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:26,125
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

186
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,603
That's his fuckin' wife, man.
This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit.

187
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:33,469
You know what I'm sayin'?

188
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,475
It's an interestin' point.

189
00:13:35,543 --> 00:13:37,477
Come on.
Let's get into character.

190
00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:46,420
- What's her name again?
- Mia.

191
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:49,513
- Mia.
- Why you so interested in big man's wife?

192
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,823
He's goin' out of town, Florida.
And he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.

193
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:58,855
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

194
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:02,300
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

195
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,895
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

196
00:14:04,972 --> 00:14:07,600
It is not a date.

197
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:11,771
It's just like if you were gonna take your
buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.

198
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:15,373
It's just good company, that's all.

199
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:24,151
It's not a date. It's definitely not a date.

200
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:34,359
Hey, kids.
How you boys doin'?

201
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:37,090
Hey, keep chillin'.

202
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,068
You know who we are?

203
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,099
We're associates of your
business partner, Marsellus Wallace.

204
00:14:50,177 --> 00:14:53,203
You do remember
your business partner, don't you?

205
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,851
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.

206
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:03,914
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

207
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:08,325
I thought so. You remember
your business partner Marsellus Wallace,

208
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:10,226
don't ya, Brett?

209
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:11,958
Yeah, I remember.

210
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:16,366
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

211
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:19,065
Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin'?

212
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,107
Hamburgers.

213
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:25,271
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

214
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:28,945
What kind of hamburgers?

215
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:30,745
- Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no.

216
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:33,912
Where'd you get 'em?
McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box?

217
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:36,786
- Where?
- Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.

218
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:39,985
Big Kahuna Burger!
That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

219
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,996
I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself. How are they?

220
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:46,760
They're-- They're good.

221
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:49,462
You mind if I try
one of yours?

222
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:51,970
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

223
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:02,079
Mmmm.

224
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:05,277
This is a tasty burger!
Vincent!

225
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:07,877
You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger?

226
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:11,414
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

227
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:14,928
- I ain't hungry.
- Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime.

228
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:18,829
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

229
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,027
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.

230
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:25,265
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmmm.

231
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:29,867
You know what they call a
Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in France?

232
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:32,003
- No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent.

233
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,106
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.

234
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:39,641
You know why they call it that?

235
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,780
Uh, because of
the metric system?

236
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:47,156
Check out the big brain
on Brett!

237
00:16:47,227 --> 00:16:50,560
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

238
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,027
- What's in this?
- Sprite.

239
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:57,036
Sprite. Good.

240
00:16:57,104 --> 00:17:00,972
You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with?

241
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,908
Go right ahead.

242
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:18,189
That hit the spot.

243
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:22,319
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

244
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:25,923
- Why don't you tell my man Vince here
where you got the shit hid. - It's over--

245
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,595
I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing!

246
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:35,104
You were sayin'?

247
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:37,234
It's in the cupboard.

248
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:42,983
N-No, the one
by your kn-knees.

249
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:06,169
We happy?

250
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,107
Vincent?

251
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:11,872
- We happy?
- Yeah, we happy.

252
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:18,247
Look, I'm sorry, uh, l--
I didn't get your name.

253
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:21,515
I got yours. Vincent. Right?
B-But I never got yours.

254
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:26,924
- My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin'
your way outta this shit. - No, no, no.

255
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:31,330
I just want you
to know how--

256
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:37,459
I just want you to know how sorry we are
th-that things got so fucked up...

257
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:39,733
with us and Mr. Wallace.

258
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:44,301
W-We got into this thing with
the best intentions. Really. I never--

259
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:47,779
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I break your concentration?

260
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:50,442
I didn't mean to do that. Please.

261
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:55,682
Continue. You were saying something
about "best intentions."

262
00:18:57,091 --> 00:19:00,993
What's the matter?
Oh, you were finished!

263
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:03,791
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

264
00:19:07,334 --> 00:19:10,326
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like?

265
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:12,599
What?

266
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:15,938
- What country you from?
- What?

267
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:20,275
- "What" ain't no country I ever heard of.
They speak English in What? - W-What?

268
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:23,043
- English, motherfucker! Do you speak it?
- Yes!

269
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:24,812
- Then you know what I'm sayin'!
- Yes.

270
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:28,321
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

271
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:31,016
- What? L--
- Say "what" again!

272
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:35,027
Say "what" again! I dare ya!
I double dare you, motherfucker!

273
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:38,997
- Say "what" one more goddamn time!
- H-H-He's black.

274
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:41,398
- Go on!
- He's bald!

275
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:44,198
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

276
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:49,966
Does he look... Iike a bitch?

277
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:53,274
- No!
- Then why you tryin' to fuck him like a bitch?

278
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:56,976
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!

279
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,211
- You tried to fuck him.
- No, no.

280
00:19:59,286 --> 00:20:04,553
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

281
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,685
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!

282
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:12,323
Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
Sort of fits this occasion.

283
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,731
Ezekiel 25:17.

284
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:18,100
"The path of the righteous man...

285
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:22,108
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish...

286
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:25,111
and the tyranny of evil men.

287
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:30,116
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and goodwill,

288
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:33,347
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

289
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,082
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

290
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:39,717
and the finder
of lost children.

291
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:43,593
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...

292
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:45,632
and furious anger...

293
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:50,363
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers!

294
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:54,271
And you will know
My name is the Lord...

295
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:57,742
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee!"

296
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:18,625
I think you gonna find...

297
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:21,361
when all this shit
is over and done--

298
00:21:23,036 --> 00:21:27,405
I think you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker.

299
00:21:28,976 --> 00:21:31,774
The thing is, Butch,

300
00:21:31,845 --> 00:21:34,871
right now...
you got ability.

301
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,984
But painful as it may be,

302
00:21:39,052 --> 00:21:42,215
ability... don't last.

303
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:48,287
And your days are just about over.

304
00:21:48,362 --> 00:21:52,765
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.

305
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:57,861
But that's a fact of life your ass
is gonna have to get realistic about.

306
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:05,234
You see, this business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

307
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:09,271
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

308
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:14,715
If you mean it turns
to vinegar... it does.

309
00:22:15,956 --> 00:22:20,222
If you mean it gets better
with age... it don't.

310
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:23,863
Besides, Butch,

311
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,228
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?

312
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:31,498
Hmm?

313
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:33,539
Two?

314
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:38,042
Boxers don't have
an old-timers' day.

315
00:22:39,146 --> 00:22:43,139
You came close,
but you never made it.

316
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:47,414
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.

317
00:23:04,137 --> 00:23:06,401
You my nigger?

318
00:23:11,078 --> 00:23:13,478
Certainly appears so.

319
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,856
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

320
00:23:26,993 --> 00:23:30,360
That's pride fuckin' with you.

321
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,025
Fuck pride!

322
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:38,795
Pride only hurts.

323
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:40,806
It never helps.

324
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:44,267
You fight through that shit.

325
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:50,682
'Cause a year from now,
when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,

326
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:55,695
you gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

327
00:23:57,664 --> 00:24:01,930
I got no problem
with that, Mr. Wallace.

328
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:05,801
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.

329
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:11,810
Say it.

330
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,516
In the fifth,
my ass goes down.

331
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:21,977
Yo, Vincent Vega.
Our man in Amsterdam.

332
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:26,515
Jules Winfield, our man in lnglewood.
Get your asses on in here.

333
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:30,427
- Goddamn, nigger, what's up with them clothes?
- You don't even want to know.

334
00:24:30,497 --> 00:24:33,762
Where's the big man?

335
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,768
The big man's right over there
takin' care of some business.

336
00:24:36,836 --> 00:24:41,296
Why don't you hang back a second or two.
You see the white boy leave, go on over.

337
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,274
How ya been?

338
00:24:46,346 --> 00:24:50,282
- I been doin' pretty good. How 'bout yourself?
- All right.

339
00:24:51,885 --> 00:24:54,752
So I hear you're
takin' Mia out tomorrow.

340
00:24:57,891 --> 00:25:00,086
At Marsellus's request.

341
00:25:01,361 --> 00:25:03,921
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet.

342
00:25:03,997 --> 00:25:07,194
What's so fuckin' funny?

343
00:25:07,267 --> 00:25:09,861
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.

344
00:25:09,936 --> 00:25:14,202
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot,
all right? It's the big man's wife.

345
00:25:14,274 --> 00:25:16,936
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed,

346
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,978
Iaugh at her fuckin' jokes,
and that's it.

347
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:22,173
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

348
00:25:22,248 --> 00:25:25,308
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for?

349
00:25:25,385 --> 00:25:27,876
Asshole.

350
00:25:34,127 --> 00:25:36,322
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
- Filters?

351
00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:38,330
No.

352
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:45,069
- You lookin' at somethin', friend?
- You ain't my friend, palooka.

353
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:50,665
- What was that?
- I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

354
00:25:50,743 --> 00:25:53,337
Vincent Vega's in the house?

355
00:25:53,413 --> 00:25:56,712
My nigger,
get your ass over here.

356
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:07,088
- What's up?
- Man, I'm really sorry.

357
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,321
You shouldn't worry about it.

358
00:26:09,395 --> 00:26:12,364
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.

359
00:26:14,868 --> 00:26:17,200
And some matches.

360
00:26:20,306 --> 00:26:22,240
Thanks.

361
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:28,444
It's as if it turns every part
of your body into the tip of a penis.

362
00:26:28,515 --> 00:26:32,417
- Whoa.
- I'll lend it to you. It's a great book on piercing.

363
00:26:32,485 --> 00:26:36,888
That gun to pierce your ears,
they don't use that to pierce your nipples, do they?

364
00:26:36,956 --> 00:26:40,824
Forget that gun. That guns goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

365
00:26:40,894 --> 00:26:45,763
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of 'em done with a needle.

366
00:26:45,832 --> 00:26:49,324
Five in each ear, one through
the nipple of my left breast,

367
00:26:49,402 --> 00:26:52,530
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow,

368
00:26:52,605 --> 00:26:55,472
one in my belly,
one in my lip, one in my clit,

369
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:59,000
- and I wear a stud in my tongue.
- Excuse me.

370
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:01,012
I was just curious,

371
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,948
but, um... why would you wear
a stud in your tongue?

372
00:27:05,018 --> 00:27:08,510
Sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

373
00:27:08,588 --> 00:27:12,547
Vincenzo.
Step in my office.

374
00:27:19,332 --> 00:27:22,392
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.

375
00:27:22,468 --> 00:27:25,904
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.

376
00:27:25,972 --> 00:27:28,907
And that is Choco
from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

377
00:27:28,975 --> 00:27:33,412
Now, the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

378
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:36,448
But this one
is a little more expensive.

379
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:38,916
This is 500 a gram.

380
00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:42,386
But, when you shoot it, you will know
where that extra money went.

381
00:27:42,455 --> 00:27:46,551
There's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.

382
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:50,289
But this one
is a fuckin' madman.

383
00:27:50,363 --> 00:27:53,127
Remember, I just got back
from Amsterdam.

384
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:56,225
Am I a nigger?
Are we in lnglewood? No.

385
00:27:56,302 --> 00:27:59,465
You're in my home. Now, white people
who know the difference...

386
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:02,531
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

387
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:05,976
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...

388
00:28:06,045 --> 00:28:09,344
- any old day of the fuckin' week.
- That's a bold statement.

389
00:28:09,415 --> 00:28:13,283
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a seller's market.

390
00:28:13,353 --> 00:28:17,346
Coke is fuckin' dead
as... dead.

391
00:28:17,423 --> 00:28:21,291
Heroin, it's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way.

392
00:28:22,562 --> 00:28:26,020
- All right. Gimme three grams of madman.
- Okay.

393
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:29,535
Now, if it's as good as you say it is,
I'll come back and buy another thousand.

394
00:28:29,602 --> 00:28:32,366
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya,

395
00:28:32,438 --> 00:28:36,636
but I'm givin' you some
out of my own private stash.

396
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:39,872
That is what a nice guy I am.

397
00:28:39,946 --> 00:28:44,042
- I'm outta balloons. Is a baggie all right?
- Yeah, that's cool.

398
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:46,108
All right.
I'll just get one for ya.

399
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:51,122
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?

400
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,158
Okay.

401
00:28:53,226 --> 00:28:56,753
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?
She ain't got a boyfriend.

402
00:28:56,829 --> 00:29:00,128
- You wanna hang out and get high?
- Which one's Trudi?

403
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:04,363
- The one with all the shit in her face?
- No, that's Jody.

404
00:29:04,437 --> 00:29:06,871
That's my wife.

405
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:11,535
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

406
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:15,479
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.
- All right, no problemo.

407
00:29:15,548 --> 00:29:18,278
I'll take a rain check.

408
00:29:18,351 --> 00:29:21,684
- Oh.
- Thank you, Jody.

409
00:29:21,754 --> 00:29:25,053
Still got your Malibu?

410
00:29:25,124 --> 00:29:28,218
Oh, man, you know what some fucker
did the other day?

411
00:29:28,294 --> 00:29:30,228
- What?
- Fuckin' keyed it.

412
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:33,891
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.

413
00:29:33,966 --> 00:29:36,662
I had it in storage
for three years.

414
00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:41,070
It was out five days, and some
dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

415
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,577
They should be fuckin' killed, man.
No trial, no jury, straight to execution.

416
00:29:45,645 --> 00:29:50,378
I wish I could've caught him doin' it.
I'd have given anything to catch that asshole.

417
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:55,183
- It'd been worth him doin' it just so I
could've caught him. - What a fucker!

418
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:58,052
What's more chicken-shit
than fuckin' with a man's automobile?

419
00:29:58,124 --> 00:30:01,025
- Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
- You don't do it.

420
00:30:01,094 --> 00:30:03,494
- It's just against the rules.
- Thank you.

421
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:05,724
Thank you.

422
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:08,596
- Mind if I shoot up here?
- Hey, mi casa es su casa.

423
00:30:08,668 --> 00:30:11,967
Muchas gracias.

424
00:31:54,905 --> 00:31:59,001
Hi, Vincent.
I'm getting dressed. The door's open.

425
00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:03,274
Come inside and make yourself
a drink. Mia.

426
00:32:12,189 --> 00:32:14,157
Hello?

427
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:18,719
Billy Raye was a preacher's son and when
his daddy would visit he'd come along

428
00:32:18,796 --> 00:32:20,923
Vincent.

429
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:25,499
Vincent.

430
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,503
I'm on the intercom.

431
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,199
Where is--
Where is the intercom?

432
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:33,607
It's on the wall
by the two African fellows.

433
00:32:33,678 --> 00:32:35,771
To your right.

434
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,009
Warm.

435
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:43,178
Warmer.

436
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:45,245
Disco.

437
00:32:45,322 --> 00:32:47,916
Hello?

438
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:51,325
Push the button
if you want to talk.

439
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:53,454
Hello?

440
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:57,365
Go make yourself a drink, and I'll
be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

441
00:32:57,435 --> 00:33:00,836
The bar's by the fireplace.

442
00:33:02,707 --> 00:33:04,766
Okay.

443
00:33:04,842 --> 00:33:07,276
When he started
sweet talkin' to me

444
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:10,108
He come and tell me
everything is all right

445
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:12,843
He'd kiss me and tell me
everything is all right

446
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:14,851
Can I get away
again tonight

447
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:17,513
The only one who could
ever reach me

448
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:20,216
Was the son
of a preacher man

449
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:23,351
The only boy
who could ever teach me

450
00:33:23,427 --> 00:33:26,396
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was

451
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:28,762
He was

452
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:31,461
- Lord he knows he was
- Yes he was

453
00:33:34,105 --> 00:33:36,539
How will I remember

454
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:39,337
The look was in his eyes

455
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,901
Stealing kisses from me
on the sly

456
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:44,573
Taking time to make time

457
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:47,139
Telling me that
he's all mine

458
00:33:47,218 --> 00:33:50,153
Learning from each other's knowin'

459
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:52,314
Looking to see
how much we've grown

460
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:54,857
And the only one
who could ever reach me

461
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:57,189
Was the son
of a preacher man

462
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:00,230
The only boy
who could ever teach me

463
00:34:00,297 --> 00:34:02,663
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was

464
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:05,531
- Was, was
- He was

465
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:08,299
Oh, yes he was

466
00:34:08,372 --> 00:34:10,203
Let's go.

467
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:17,814
What the fuck is this place?

468
00:34:17,882 --> 00:34:21,374
This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

469
00:34:21,452 --> 00:34:23,784
An Elvis man should love it.

470
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:28,052
- Come on, Mia. Let's go get a steak.
- You can get a steak here, daddy-o.

471
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:30,923
Don't be a--

472
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:34,431
Oh, after you, kitty-cat.

473
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:57,650
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, how may I help you?

474
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:00,554
- There's a reservation under Wallace.
- Wallace?

475
00:35:00,624 --> 00:35:03,525
We reserved a car.

476
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:09,123
Oh, a car. Why don't you seat 'em
over there in the Chrysler.

477
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,567
School get out, baby
Gonna tell you some news

478
00:35:12,636 --> 00:35:14,797
Sure do look good
in them baby doll shoes

479
00:35:14,872 --> 00:35:19,639
One, two, buckle the shoes
Three, four, get out on the floor

480
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:25,012
Five, six, come get your kicks down at
the corner of Lincoln and 46th, yeah

481
00:35:28,352 --> 00:35:30,547
All right

482
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:35,387
I've been waitin' in school
all day long

483
00:35:35,459 --> 00:35:37,552
Waiting on the bell to ring
so I can go home

484
00:35:37,628 --> 00:35:40,119
Throw my books on the table
Pick up the telephone

485
00:35:40,197 --> 00:35:42,290
- Come on, baby
- Coffee, please? Decaf.

486
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:44,664
- Just a minute.
- Heading down to the drugstore to get a soda pop

487
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:47,101
Throw a nickel in the jukebox
Then we start to rock

488
00:35:47,171 --> 00:35:49,230
School's out, baby
Gonna tell you some news

489
00:35:49,306 --> 00:35:51,365
You sure do look good

00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:54,104
Well, it's one, two
Buckle the shoes

491
00:35:54,178 --> 00:35:56,510
Three, four
Get out on the floor

492
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,482
Five, six, come get your kicks
down at the corner of Lincoln and 46th

493
00:36:05,322 --> 00:36:08,314
Gonna rock all night
Just wait and see

494
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:12,123
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky!

495
00:36:13,931 --> 00:36:16,832
Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson!

496
00:36:16,901 --> 00:36:20,302
- Fantastic job, Rick. Thank you very much.
- Vincent!

497
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:27,574
Just to let you all know,
Ricky will be back in the second half of our show,

498
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:32,207
so we hope you enjoy your meals
here at Jackrabbit Slim's.

499
00:36:32,283 --> 00:36:34,649
Thank you.

500
00:36:34,718 --> 00:36:38,176
Call for...

501
00:36:38,255 --> 00:36:42,851
- Phil-lip Mor-ris.
- What do you think?

502
00:36:42,927 --> 00:36:47,626
I think it's like
a wax museum with a pulse.

503
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:51,532
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?

504
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:58,405
Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh,
yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

505
00:36:58,475 --> 00:37:01,273
- I'll have that.
- How do you want that cooked?

506
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:04,644
- Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?
- Bloody as hell, and--

507
00:37:04,715 --> 00:37:07,445
Oh, yeah, look at this--
vanilla Coke.

508
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:09,486
What about you, Peggy Sue?

509
00:37:09,553 --> 00:37:12,886
I'll have the...

510
00:37:12,957 --> 00:37:17,291
Durward Kirby burger, bloody.

511
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:21,263
And... a five-dollar shake.

512
00:37:21,332 --> 00:37:24,062
How do you want that shake,
Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?

513
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:28,264
- Martin and Lewis.
- Did you just order a five-dollar shake?

514
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:30,398
Mm-hmm.

515
00:37:30,474 --> 00:37:33,637
That's a shake?
That's milk and ice cream?

516
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:38,114
- Last I heard. - That's five dollars?
You don't put bourbon in it or nothin'?

517
00:37:38,182 --> 00:37:40,548
- No.
- Just checking.

518
00:37:40,617 --> 00:37:43,313
I'll be right back
with your drinks.

519
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,321
To Lonesome Town

520
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:49,348
To cry my troubles away

521
00:37:50,961 --> 00:37:55,022
Could you, um...
roll me one of those, cowboy?

522
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:57,966
You can have this one, cowgirl.

523
00:37:58,035 --> 00:37:59,969
Thanks.

524
00:38:00,037 --> 00:38:02,437
The streets are filled
with regret

525
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,733
Think nothin' of it.

526
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,644
Lay me down
in Lonesome Town

527
00:38:10,714 --> 00:38:14,241
- I can learn to forget
- So...

528
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:17,412
Marsellus said
you just got back from Amsterdam.

529
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:20,616
- Sure did.
- How long were you there?

530
00:38:20,691 --> 00:38:23,216
Just over three years.

531
00:38:25,763 --> 00:38:28,596
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

532
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:32,396
No kiddin'?
I didn't know that.

533
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:35,404
Why would you?

534
00:38:40,077 --> 00:38:42,011
I heard you did a pilot.

535
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,977
- That was my 15 minutes.
- What was it?

536
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:51,750
It was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five.

537
00:38:51,822 --> 00:38:54,552
- What?
- Fox Force Five.

538
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,889
Fox, as in were a bunch
of foxy chicks.

539
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,428
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

540
00:38:59,496 --> 00:39:02,260
And five, as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.

541
00:39:02,332 --> 00:39:06,029
There was a blond one,
Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.

542
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:09,231
The Japanese fox
was a kung fu master.

543
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:13,367
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

544
00:39:13,444 --> 00:39:16,311
French fox's speciality was sex.

545
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,749
- What was your speciality?
- Knives.

546
00:39:20,883 --> 00:39:22,851
The character I played,
Raven McCoy,

547
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:26,786
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

548
00:39:26,855 --> 00:39:31,121
According to the show,
she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife.

549
00:39:31,193 --> 00:39:33,957
And she knew
a zillion old jokes.

550
00:39:34,029 --> 00:39:38,159
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

551
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:41,532
And if we would have got picked up,
they would've worked in a gimmick...

552
00:39:41,603 --> 00:39:45,471
where every show
I would've told another joke.

553
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,439
You know any of them old jokes?

554
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:53,242
Well, I only got the chance to say one
'cause we only did one show.

555
00:39:53,315 --> 00:39:55,875
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

556
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:58,878
Don't be that way.
Tell me.

557
00:39:58,954 --> 00:40:02,651
- No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed.
- You'd be embarr--

558
00:40:02,724 --> 00:40:06,660
You told 50 million people,
and you can't tell me?

559
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:10,596
- I promise I won't laugh.
- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

560
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:12,998
That's not what I meant.
You know it.

561
00:40:13,068 --> 00:40:16,504
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you
'cause it's been built up too much.

562
00:40:16,572 --> 00:40:19,166
What a gyp.

563
00:40:20,342 --> 00:40:22,708
Martin and Lewis.

564
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:28,181
Vanilla Coke.

565
00:40:32,521 --> 00:40:35,854
Mmm. Yummy.

566
00:40:35,924 --> 00:40:38,893
You think I could
have a sip of that?

567
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:42,590
Be my guest.

568
00:40:42,664 --> 00:40:46,691
I gotta know what
a five-dollar shake tastes like.

569
00:40:46,768 --> 00:40:50,226
- You can use my straw. I don't have cooties.
- Yeah, but maybe I do.

570
00:40:50,305 --> 00:40:53,172
Cooties I can handle.

571
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,210
All right.

572
00:41:02,284 --> 00:41:05,082
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milkshake!

573
00:41:05,153 --> 00:41:09,214
- Told ya. - I don't know if it was worth $5,
but it's pretty fuckin' good.

574
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:47,686
- Don't you hate that?
- Hate what?

575
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:50,095
Uncomfortable silences.

576
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,628
Why do we feel it's necessary to yak
about bullshit in order to be comfortable?

577
00:41:56,705 --> 00:42:00,641
I don't know.
That's a good question.

578
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:05,442
That's when you know
you found somebody really special.

579
00:42:05,514 --> 00:42:10,213
When you can just shut the fuck up for
a minute and comfortably share silence.

580
00:42:10,285 --> 00:42:14,381
Well, I don't think we're quite there yet,
but don't feel bad. We just met each other.

581
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:19,019
I'll tell you what.

582
00:42:19,094 --> 00:42:22,359
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

583
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:25,628
You sit here...
and think of something to say.

584
00:42:26,868 --> 00:42:28,802
I'll do that.

585
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:33,073
Okay.

586
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,528
I said goddamn!

587
00:43:00,602 --> 00:43:03,765
Goddamn!
Goddamn.

588
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,969
I need some hair spray.

589
00:43:14,816 --> 00:43:16,807
Mmmm.

590
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:21,219
Don't you just love it when you come back from
the bathroom to find your food waiting for you?

591
00:43:21,289 --> 00:43:23,689
We're lucky
we got anything at all.

592
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:26,887
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

593
00:43:26,962 --> 00:43:30,090
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

594
00:43:30,165 --> 00:43:33,225
- Which one? There's two Monroes.
- No, there's not.

595
00:43:33,301 --> 00:43:35,633
That is Marilyn Monroe.

596
00:43:35,704 --> 00:43:38,434
That is Mamie Van Doren.

597
00:43:38,507 --> 00:43:43,444
I don't see Jayne Mansfield,
so she must have the night off.

598
00:43:43,512 --> 00:43:46,948
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah. I got my moments.

599
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:51,384
- So did you think of somethin' to say?
- Actually, I did.

600
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:54,989
However...

601
00:43:56,692 --> 00:43:59,718
you seem like
a really nice person, and l--

602
00:43:59,795 --> 00:44:02,628
- I don't want to offend you.
- Oooh.

603
00:44:02,698 --> 00:44:07,897
This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless, boring,
gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

604
00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:10,961
This sounds like you
actually have somethin' to say.

605
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:13,872
Well, well, I do. I do.

606
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:18,003
- But you have to promise not to be offended.
- No, no.

607
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,312
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

608
00:44:22,384 --> 00:44:27,253
You can ask me what you're gonna ask me,
and my natural response could be to get offended.

609
00:44:27,322 --> 00:44:29,688
Then, through no fault of my own,
I would have broken my promise.

610
00:44:29,758 --> 00:44:32,454
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.

611
00:44:32,527 --> 00:44:36,588
Trying to forget anything as intriguing
as this would be an exercise in futility.

612
00:44:36,665 --> 00:44:38,860
- Is that a fact?
- And besides,

613
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:43,962
- isn't it more, uh, exciting when you don't
have permission? - All right, all right.

614
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:46,837
Well, here goes.

615
00:44:46,908 --> 00:44:49,934
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?

616
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:53,447
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

617
00:44:53,515 --> 00:44:56,746
- He fell out of a window.
- Hmm. Hmm.

618
00:44:56,818 --> 00:45:01,517
Well, that is one way to say it.
Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out.

619
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,753
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.

620
00:45:04,826 --> 00:45:09,957
Yet even another way is to say he was thrown
out of a window by Marsellus because of you.

621
00:45:10,031 --> 00:45:12,465
- Is that a fact?
- No.

622
00:45:12,534 --> 00:45:15,662
No, it's not a fact. It's just what
I heard. That's just what I heard.

623
00:45:15,737 --> 00:45:18,638
- Who told you?
- They.

624
00:45:18,707 --> 00:45:21,175
"They" talk a lot, don't they?

625
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:26,007
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

626
00:45:26,081 --> 00:45:30,484
- Don't be shy, Vincent. What else did "they" say?
- I'm-- I'm not shy.

627
00:45:30,552 --> 00:45:33,077
- Um--
- Did it involve the "F" word?

628
00:45:33,155 --> 00:45:37,148
No, no, no, no, no. They just said that
Antwan had given you a foot massage.

629
00:45:38,693 --> 00:45:41,321
- And?
- And-- And nothin'.

630
00:45:41,396 --> 00:45:44,263
That's it.

631
00:45:44,332 --> 00:45:46,391
You heard Marsellus...

632
00:45:46,468 --> 00:45:50,837
threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story
window for giving me a foot massage?

633
00:45:50,906 --> 00:45:52,840
- Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

634
00:45:52,908 --> 00:45:57,436
Well, at the time
I was told it sounded reasonable.

635
00:45:57,512 --> 00:46:00,606
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...

636
00:46:00,682 --> 00:46:03,742
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

637
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:07,277
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

638
00:46:07,355 --> 00:46:10,017
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

639
00:46:10,091 --> 00:46:14,721
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

640
00:46:14,796 --> 00:46:18,527
A husband almost killing another man for
touching his wife's feet is something else.

641
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,194
But did it happen?

642
00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:27,105
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was
my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.

643
00:46:27,175 --> 00:46:29,575
Really?

644
00:46:29,644 --> 00:46:32,977
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that window...

645
00:46:33,048 --> 00:46:34,982
except Marsellus and Tony.

646
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:39,043
When you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

647
00:46:39,187 --> 00:46:43,055
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

648
00:46:43,124 --> 00:46:48,152
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

649
00:46:50,565 --> 00:46:54,899
Now, this is where
one lucky couple...

650
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:59,430
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

651
00:46:59,507 --> 00:47:03,068
Now, who will be
our first contestants?

652
00:47:03,144 --> 00:47:05,408
- Right here!
- All right!

653
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,506
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.

654
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:13,316
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss,

655
00:47:13,388 --> 00:47:16,824
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

656
00:47:16,892 --> 00:47:20,589
Now I wanna dance;
I wanna win; I want that trophy.

657
00:47:20,662 --> 00:47:21,871
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

658
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:23,202
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

659
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:26,242
Let's hear it
for our first contestants.

660
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:36,114
Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening.
Young lady, what is your name?

661
00:47:36,185 --> 00:47:38,176
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

662
00:47:38,254 --> 00:47:40,882
And how 'bout your fella here?

663
00:47:40,957 --> 00:47:42,788
Vincent Vega.

664
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:46,295
All right, let's see what you can do.
Take it away!

665
00:47:46,362 --> 00:47:49,297
- Go for it.
- Come on!

666
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:11,543
It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

667
00:48:13,556 --> 00:48:17,515
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

668
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:23,692
And now the young monsieur
and madame have rung the chapel bell

669
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:29,968
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

670
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:36,005
They furnished off an apartment
with a two-room Roebucks sale

671
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:42,180
The 'coolerador was crammed
with TV dinners and ginger ale

672
00:48:44,053 --> 00:48:47,955
But when Pierre found work the
little money comin' worked out well

673
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:54,325
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

674
00:48:56,032 --> 00:49:00,401
They had a hi-fi phono
and boy did they let it blast

675
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:06,704
Seven hundred little records
all rock, rhythm and jazz

676
00:49:08,444 --> 00:49:12,540
But when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell

677
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:19,512
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

678
00:49:45,014 --> 00:49:49,246
They had a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

679
00:49:51,287 --> 00:49:55,246
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

680
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,657
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

681
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:37,097
I don't know
what you call that.

682
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:39,794
Drinks! Music!

683
00:50:40,803 --> 00:50:43,033
I'm gonna take a piss.

684
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:48,066
That's a little bit more information
than I needed, but go right ahead.

685
00:51:01,157 --> 00:51:03,057
Girl

686
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,991
Bomp, bomp, bom

687
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:08,553
You'll be a woman soon

688
00:51:11,734 --> 00:51:14,202
I love you so much
Can't count all the ways

689
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,262
I'd die for you, girl
and all they can say is

690
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:20,537
He's not your kind

691
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:25,843
You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around

692
00:51:25,915 --> 00:51:28,281
What I'm gonna find

693
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:32,447
Don't let them
make up your mind

694
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:35,389
Don't you know, girl

695
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:40,388
You'll be a woman soon

696
00:51:40,463 --> 00:51:43,557
One drink, and that's it.

697
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:47,467
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink, but do it quickly.

698
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:51,506
Say good night...
and go home.

699
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:58,040
You'll be a woman soon

700
00:51:59,248 --> 00:52:01,307
Soon

701
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,851
You'll be a woman

702
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:10,320
I've been misunderstood
for all of my life

703
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,725
But what they're sayin', girl
it cuts like a knife

704
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:15,161
The boy's no good

705
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,927
Well, I've finally have found
what I been lookin' for

706
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,403
But if they get a chance they'll
end it for sure Sure they would

707
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:25,167
Baby, I've done
all I could

708
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:29,905
You see, this is
a moral test of oneself.

709
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:33,244
Whether or not
you can maintain loyalty.

710
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,615
Because... being loyal
is very important.

711
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:41,282
You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around

712
00:52:41,357 --> 00:52:43,985
What I'm gonna find

713
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,019
Don't let them
make up your mind

714
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:50,930
Don't you know, girl

715
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:56,369
You'll be a woman soon

716
00:52:57,907 --> 00:52:59,841
Please

717
00:53:01,043 --> 00:53:04,206
Come take my hand

718
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,283
Girl

719
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:13,555
You'll be a woman soon

720
00:53:14,957 --> 00:53:16,891
Please

721
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:21,124
Come take my hand

722
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,766
- Hello.
- Girl

723
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:30,271
So, you're gonna go out there
and you're gonna say, "Good night.

724
00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:32,864
I've had a very lovely evening."

725
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:38,005
Walk out the door, get in the car, go home,
jerk off, and that's all you gonna do.

726
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:45,787
Now it's up to you, girl

727
00:53:47,523 --> 00:53:51,482
You'll be a woman soon

728
00:53:53,162 --> 00:53:56,063
Please

729
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,760
Come take my hand

730
00:54:01,337 --> 00:54:04,636
Girl

731
00:54:04,707 --> 00:54:08,404
You'll be a woman soon

732
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:12,080
Soon

733
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:16,243
You'll be a woman

734
00:54:25,828 --> 00:54:28,126
All right, Mia.

735
00:54:28,197 --> 00:54:31,291
So listen, I gotta go,
all right?

736
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,804
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

737
00:54:37,873 --> 00:54:40,603
You fu--
Oh, Jesus Christ!

738
00:54:40,676 --> 00:54:42,974
Oh, fuck me.
Fuck me!

739
00:54:43,045 --> 00:54:47,732
Oh-- Come on, girl. We're gettin'
outta here. We gotta walk now.

740
00:54:57,509 --> 00:55:00,603
Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia!

741
00:55:00,678 --> 00:55:02,612
Fuck!

742
00:55:09,788 --> 00:55:11,722
Answer.

743
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:14,224
Have you got the ring?

744
00:55:14,292 --> 00:55:18,126
- Why, certainly.
- Join hands, you two lovebirds.

745
00:55:18,196 --> 00:55:20,630
Please! Please!

746
00:55:20,698 --> 00:55:23,360
Yes, yes.
Hold hands, you lovebirds.

747
00:55:29,607 --> 00:55:31,768
Fuck you, Lance!
Answer!

748
00:55:36,848 --> 00:55:38,782
Now what do you say?

749
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:41,785
I give up!
I'll marry you!

750
00:55:41,853 --> 00:55:46,517
Lance! The goddamn phone's ringing!

751
00:55:48,226 --> 00:55:50,160
I can hear it.

752
00:55:50,228 --> 00:55:53,664
I thought you told those fuckin'
assholes never to call here this late!

753
00:55:53,731 --> 00:55:55,665
Yeah, I told them.

754
00:55:55,733 --> 00:55:58,998
And that is exactly what I'm going
to tell this fucking asshole right now.

755
00:56:00,572 --> 00:56:03,405
- Don't you dare strike me!
- Hello.

756
00:56:03,475 --> 00:56:05,739
Lance! Vincent.

757
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:08,745
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
I'm coming to your house.

758
00:56:08,813 --> 00:56:12,909
W-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man.
W-What's the problem?

759
00:56:12,984 --> 00:56:16,249
- I got this chick, she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me!
- Well, don't bring her here!

760
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:20,655
I'm not even joking with you! Do not be
bringing some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!

761
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:22,784
- No choice.
- Wh-- She's O.D.in'?

762
00:56:22,861 --> 00:56:26,058
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
- Just dandy.

763
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:30,328
Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet,
take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.

764
00:56:30,401 --> 00:56:32,835
- Negative!
- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!

765
00:56:32,904 --> 00:56:36,635
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

766
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:39,541
Uh, are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone?

767
00:56:39,611 --> 00:56:42,045
I don't know you.
Who is this? Don't come here!

768
00:56:42,113 --> 00:56:45,446
I'm hanging up the phone!
Prank caller! Prank caller!

769
00:56:53,525 --> 00:56:56,460
What the hell was that?

770
00:56:58,429 --> 00:57:00,863
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

771
00:57:00,932 --> 00:57:03,867
- You were talking about drug shit on a cellular phone!
- Lance, help me.

772
00:57:03,935 --> 00:57:06,870
- You crashed your car into my fucking house!
- Grab her feet.

773
00:57:06,938 --> 00:57:10,374
Are you deaf? You are not bringing
this fucked-up bitch into my house!

774
00:57:10,441 --> 00:57:13,376
This "fucked-up bitch"
is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

775
00:57:13,444 --> 00:57:15,878
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
- Yeah.

776
00:57:15,947 --> 00:57:18,882
If she croaks on me,
I am a fucking grease spot!

777
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:23,546
I will be forced to tell him that you did
not help and let her die on your lawn.

778
00:57:23,621 --> 00:57:26,556
Now, come on. Help me, help me.
Pick her up.

779
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:29,559
Shit.

780
00:57:31,629 --> 00:57:33,995
Lance!

781
00:57:34,065 --> 00:57:35,999
Shit.

782
00:57:36,067 --> 00:57:38,501
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

783
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:41,903
What the fuck's going on out here?

784
00:57:41,973 --> 00:57:43,907
Who's she?

785
00:57:43,975 --> 00:57:46,910
Go to the fridge and get the thing
with the adrenalin shot.

786
00:57:46,978 --> 00:57:49,037
- What's wrong with her?
- She's O.D.ing!

787
00:57:49,113 --> 00:57:51,172
- Get her outta here!
- Get the shot!

788
00:57:51,249 --> 00:57:54,776
- Fuck you! Fuck you too!
- What a fuckin' bitch.

789
00:57:54,852 --> 00:57:56,786
Just keep talking to her,
all right?

790
00:57:56,854 --> 00:57:59,789
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going
to go get my little black medical book.

791
00:57:59,857 --> 00:58:01,848
What the fuck you need
a medical book for?

792
00:58:01,926 --> 00:58:03,860
I've never had to give
an adrenalin shot before!

793
00:58:03,928 --> 00:58:07,364
I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers!
My friends can handle their highs!

794
00:58:07,432 --> 00:58:09,866
- Get the shot!
- I am, if you'll let me!

795
00:58:09,934 --> 00:58:12,869
- I ain't stopping you!
- Stop talking to me. Start talking to her!

796
00:58:12,937 --> 00:58:14,871
- Get the shot!
- All right!

797
00:58:18,042 --> 00:58:21,478
- Hurry up. We're losing her!
- I'm looking as fast as I can!

798
00:58:21,546 --> 00:58:23,480
What's he looking for?

799
00:58:23,548 --> 00:58:26,483
- I don't know. Some book.
- What are you looking for?

800
00:58:26,551 --> 00:58:29,486
- A little black medical book.
- What are you looking for?

801
00:58:29,554 --> 00:58:33,650
My little black medical book! It's
like a textbook they give to nurses.

802
00:58:33,725 --> 00:58:36,660
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.

803
00:58:36,728 --> 00:58:39,663
- If it's so important,
why don't you keep it with the shot? - I don't know!

804
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:43,667
- Stop bothering me! - While you're looking,
that girl's gonna die on our carpet.

805
00:58:43,735 --> 00:58:45,669
You're never gonna find
anything in this mess!

806
00:58:45,737 --> 00:58:49,639
- I'm gonna fucking kill you if you don't shut up!
- Lance, get in here!

807
00:58:49,707 --> 00:58:53,939
- Right? Pig.
- Get the fuck outta my way.

808
00:58:54,012 --> 00:58:57,448
- Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot.
- While I'm doing this,

809
00:58:57,515 --> 00:59:00,848
you take off her shirt
and find her heart.

810
00:59:00,918 --> 00:59:04,479
- Does it gotta be exact? - We're giving her
a shot in the heart, so it's gotta be exact.

811
00:59:04,555 --> 00:59:07,490
I don't know exactly where her heart is.
I think it's right here.

812
00:59:07,558 --> 00:59:11,221
- That's it.
- All right, what I need is a big, fat magic marker.

813
00:59:11,295 --> 00:59:13,229
- You got it?
- What?

814
00:59:13,297 --> 00:59:15,993
A magic marker.
A felt pen!

815
00:59:16,067 --> 00:59:18,695
A fuckin' black magic marker!
Christ.

816
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:23,833
- Come on, man. Hurry up!
- Fuck! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready.

817
00:59:27,011 --> 00:59:29,502
- Hurry up, man.
- I'll tell you what to do.

818
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,515
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- No, you're gonna give her the shot.

819
00:59:32,583 --> 00:59:35,518
- I ain't giving her the shot. I never done this before.
- I never done this either!

820
00:59:35,586 --> 00:59:38,578
I ain't starting now! You brought her here.
You give her the shot.

821
00:59:38,656 --> 00:59:42,057
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch
to your house, then I give her the shot.

822
00:59:42,126 --> 00:59:44,060
Give it to me.
Give me that.

823
00:59:44,128 --> 00:59:47,063
All right, tell me what to do.

824
00:59:47,131 --> 00:59:50,123
Okay, you're giving her an injection
of adrenalin straight to her heart.

825
00:59:50,201 --> 00:59:53,136
But she's got a breastplate-- You
gotta pierce through that. -

826
00:59:53,204 --> 00:59:56,139
You gotta bring the needle
down in a stabbing motion.

827
00:59:56,207 --> 00:59:59,643
- I gotta-- I gotta stab her three times?
- No, just stab her once!

828
00:59:59,711 --> 01:00:03,147
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.

829
01:00:03,214 --> 01:00:06,149
Once you do that,
you p-press down on the p-plunger.

830
01:00:06,217 --> 01:00:08,708
- Okay. Then what happens?
- Kinda curious about that myself.

831
01:00:08,786 --> 01:00:11,721
This ain't no fuckin' joke!
Am I gonna kill her?

832
01:00:11,789 --> 01:00:15,225
- She's supposed to come out of it like that. It's--
- All right, count to three.

833
01:00:15,293 --> 01:00:17,488
- All right. Ready?
- One.

834
01:00:22,767 --> 01:00:24,291
Two.

835
01:00:32,276 --> 01:00:34,244
Three!

836
01:00:48,826 --> 01:00:52,091
If you're all right,
then say something.

837
01:00:52,163 --> 01:00:55,189
Something.

838
01:00:55,266 --> 01:00:57,200
That was fuckin' trippy.

839
01:00:59,771 --> 01:01:03,104
- Ohh.
- Oh, man.

840
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:29,733
Mia. Mia.

841
01:01:31,903 --> 01:01:34,337
What's--

842
01:01:34,405 --> 01:01:37,203
What's your thoughts on-- on--

843
01:01:37,275 --> 01:01:39,300
on how to handle this?

844
01:01:39,377 --> 01:01:41,311
What's yours?

845
01:01:44,382 --> 01:01:48,284
Well, I'm of the opinion
that if Marsellus lived his whole life,

846
01:01:48,352 --> 01:01:52,350
he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.

847
01:01:52,484 --> 01:01:55,282
If Marsellus knew
about this incident,

848
01:01:55,353 --> 01:01:57,412
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

849
01:01:57,489 --> 01:01:59,980
I seriously doubt that.

850
01:02:00,058 --> 01:02:02,993
I can keep a secret if you can.

851
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:06,964
Shake on it?

852
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,468
Mum's the word?

853
01:02:14,539 --> 01:02:16,473
Cool.

854
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:20,875
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go home and have a heart attack.

855
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,549
Vincent.

856
01:02:27,419 --> 01:02:30,445
Do you wanna hear
my Fox Force Five joke?

857
01:02:31,523 --> 01:02:33,457
Sure.

858
01:02:33,525 --> 01:02:36,551
Except I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

859
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:39,563
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

860
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:42,964
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

861
01:02:43,034 --> 01:02:45,229
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

862
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:48,170
Three tomatoes
are walkin' down the street.

863
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:50,673
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.

864
01:02:50,742 --> 01:02:54,906
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

865
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,914
Goes back and squishes him
and says,

866
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:00,075
"Ketchup."

867
01:03:02,921 --> 01:03:04,855
Ketchup.

868
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:11,120
See you around.

869
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,880
Oh, that Paddlefoot.
He funny, silly dog.

870
01:03:35,954 --> 01:03:38,889
He think totem pole alive!

871
01:03:38,957 --> 01:03:41,687
He arctic tenderfoot!

872
01:03:41,759 --> 01:03:45,422
That totem pole been here forever!

873
01:03:45,497 --> 01:03:47,431
Butch?

874
01:03:47,499 --> 01:03:50,366
One more thing, and we'll start for--

875
01:03:50,435 --> 01:03:53,370
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah?

876
01:03:53,438 --> 01:03:57,067
- You've got a special visitor.
- Stand up. Stand up.

877
01:03:59,844 --> 01:04:04,781
Now, do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?

878
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:08,580
Well, this here is Captain Koons.

879
01:04:08,653 --> 01:04:11,588
He was in the P.O.W. camp
with Daddy.

880
01:04:16,928 --> 01:04:18,862
Hello, little man.

881
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:23,026
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.

882
01:04:23,101 --> 01:04:26,332
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.

883
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:29,430
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...

884
01:04:29,507 --> 01:04:31,975
over five years.

885
01:04:32,043 --> 01:04:33,977
Hopefully...

886
01:04:34,045 --> 01:04:36,980
you'll never have to
experience this yourself,

887
01:04:37,048 --> 01:04:40,484
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were...

888
01:04:40,552 --> 01:04:43,350
for as long as we were,

889
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:47,721
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other.

890
01:04:47,792 --> 01:04:49,726
If it'd been me who'd--

891
01:04:51,062 --> 01:04:52,996
not made it,

892
01:04:53,064 --> 01:04:57,330
Major Coolidge'd be talking right now
to my son Jim.

893
01:04:57,402 --> 01:05:01,065
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you.

894
01:05:02,473 --> 01:05:04,407
Butch...

895
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:07,878
I got something for ya.

896
01:05:14,385 --> 01:05:16,444
This watch I got here...

897
01:05:16,521 --> 01:05:21,322
was first purchased by your
great-grandfather during the first World War.

898
01:05:21,392 --> 01:05:26,056
It was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

899
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:29,691
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

900
01:05:29,767 --> 01:05:32,702
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

901
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:35,933
It was bought
by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

902
01:05:36,007 --> 01:05:38,942
on the day he set sail for Paris.

903
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:41,444
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,

904
01:05:41,512 --> 01:05:44,879
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

905
01:05:44,949 --> 01:05:48,510
when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother,

906
01:05:48,586 --> 01:05:53,023
took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can,
and in that can it stayed...

907
01:05:53,091 --> 01:05:57,528
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...

908
01:05:57,595 --> 01:06:01,326
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

909
01:06:01,399 --> 01:06:04,857
This time they called it
World War ll.

910
01:06:04,936 --> 01:06:09,930
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.

911
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:13,000
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

912
01:06:13,077 --> 01:06:16,012
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed...

913
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:20,107
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake lsland.

914
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:23,119
Your granddad was facing death.

915
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,121
He knew it.

916
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:29,125
None of those boys ever had any
illusions about leaving that island alive,

917
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:32,390
so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

918
01:06:32,463 --> 01:06:37,696
your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport,
name of Winocki--

919
01:06:37,769 --> 01:06:40,704
a man he'd never met before
in his life--

920
01:06:40,772 --> 01:06:43,741
to deliver to his infant son,

921
01:06:43,808 --> 01:06:48,404
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

922
01:06:48,479 --> 01:06:52,813
Three days later, your granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

923
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:57,150
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

924
01:06:57,221 --> 01:07:01,453
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

925
01:07:01,526 --> 01:07:03,460
This watch.

926
01:07:09,334 --> 01:07:14,772
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

927
01:07:14,839 --> 01:07:18,275
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

928
01:07:18,343 --> 01:07:22,404
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

929
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,007
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

930
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:29,781
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

931
01:07:29,854 --> 01:07:33,790
He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their greasy,
yellow hands on his boy's birthright,

932
01:07:33,858 --> 01:07:37,794
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something-- his ass.

933
01:07:37,862 --> 01:07:41,298
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

934
01:07:41,366 --> 01:07:45,564
Then he died of dysentery--
He give me the watch.

935
01:07:45,636 --> 01:07:49,504
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years.

936
01:07:49,574 --> 01:07:51,508
Then...

937
01:07:51,576 --> 01:07:55,637
after seven years,
I was sent home to my family and...

938
01:07:55,713 --> 01:07:57,647
now...

939
01:08:00,084 --> 01:08:03,019
Iittle man,
I give the watch to you.

940
01:08:25,877 --> 01:08:27,811
It's time, Butch.

941
01:08:35,553 --> 01:08:38,488
Ln the heavyweight division,

942
01:08:38,556 --> 01:08:41,719
in the right corner wearing the blue trunks,

943
01:08:41,793 --> 01:08:45,058
weighing 210 pounds,

944
01:08:45,129 --> 01:08:48,257
Floyd Ray Wilson!

945
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:53,269
It's official. It's official.

946
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:56,272
Wilson is dead! - Well, Dan,
that had to be the bloodiest,

947
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,774
hands down, the most brutal fight
this city's ever seen.

948
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:02,438
Coolidge was out of there faster than I've
ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.

949
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:05,448
- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
- My guess would be yes.

950
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:08,952
I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way
to the realization of what he was doing.

951
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:12,456
- I think any man would've left the ring that fast.
- Do you feel this tragedy...

952
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,457
is gonna affect
the world of boxing?

953
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:18,461
A tragedy like this can't help but shake the
world of boxing to its very foundations.

954
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:22,465
It's of paramount importance, during the sad
weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain--

955
01:09:57,301 --> 01:09:59,633
Man, you know I didn't--

956
01:09:59,704 --> 01:10:02,639
- Marsellus.
- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.

957
01:10:02,707 --> 01:10:04,641
I didn't do it.

958
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:07,200
- How you doing?
- Great.

959
01:10:07,278 --> 01:10:09,712
I never thanked you
for dinner.

960
01:10:11,616 --> 01:10:13,550
- What you got?
- He booked.

961
01:10:13,618 --> 01:10:16,712
- His trainer?
- Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.

962
01:10:16,787 --> 01:10:20,223
- I think Butch surprised his ass same as us.
- No, we don't wanna "think."

963
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:23,886
We wanna know. Take him to
the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.

964
01:10:23,961 --> 01:10:27,397
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

965
01:10:27,465 --> 01:10:29,399
Butch's search--
How do you want it done?

966
01:10:29,467 --> 01:10:32,402
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.

967
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:35,906
If Butch goes to lndochina, I want
a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...

968
01:10:35,973 --> 01:10:38,100
ready to pop a cap in his ass.

969
01:10:38,175 --> 01:10:40,312
I will take care of it.

970
01:10:50,055 --> 01:10:52,421
Mister.

971
01:10:55,327 --> 01:10:57,818
- Hey, mister.
- What?

972
01:10:57,896 --> 01:11:02,697
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.

973
01:11:02,768 --> 01:11:06,204
- You're the fighter?
- Whatever gave you that idea?

974
01:11:06,271 --> 01:11:09,035
No, come on.

975
01:11:09,108 --> 01:11:11,042
You're him.

976
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:13,544
I know you're him.

977
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,180
Tell me you're him.

978
01:11:17,249 --> 01:11:19,183
I'm him.

979
01:11:20,285 --> 01:11:22,719
You killed the other boxing man.

980
01:11:26,358 --> 01:11:28,451
He's dead?

981
01:11:28,527 --> 01:11:30,961
The radio said he was dead.

982
01:11:33,732 --> 01:11:35,962
Sorry about that, Floyd.

983
01:11:37,269 --> 01:11:39,760
What does it feel like?

984
01:11:39,838 --> 01:11:41,772
What does what feel like?

985
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,774
Killing a man.

986
01:11:45,544 --> 01:11:49,605
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

987
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:51,615
What are you, a weirdo?

988
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:53,617
No.

989
01:11:53,685 --> 01:11:57,121
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

990
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:02,626
You are the first person
I have ever met who has killed somebody.

991
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:07,564
So?

992
01:12:07,633 --> 01:12:10,898
What does it feel like to kill a man?

993
01:12:12,004 --> 01:12:13,938
I'll tell you what.

994
01:12:14,006 --> 01:12:17,942
Give me one of them cigarettes you got up there,
and I'll tell you all about it.

995
01:12:35,661 --> 01:12:38,892
So, Esmarelda...

996
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:43,600
Villa Lobos--
Is that Mexican?

997
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:46,900
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

998
01:12:46,972 --> 01:12:50,271
- That's some handle you got there, honey.
- Thank you.

999
01:12:50,342 --> 01:12:52,276
And what is your name?

1000
01:12:52,344 --> 01:12:54,039
Butch.

1001
01:12:54,113 --> 01:12:56,581
Butch.

1002
01:12:56,648 --> 01:13:01,415
- What does it mean?
- I'm an American, honey. Our names don't mean shit.

1003
01:13:01,487 --> 01:13:04,149
So, moving right along,

1004
01:13:04,223 --> 01:13:06,157
Esmarelda,

1005
01:13:06,225 --> 01:13:08,489
what is it you want to know?

1006
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,429
- I want to know what it feels like to kill a man.
- I couldn't tell ya.

1007
01:13:19,338 --> 01:13:23,775
Didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.

1008
01:13:23,842 --> 01:13:28,438
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?

1009
01:13:32,184 --> 01:13:35,620
I don't feel
the least bit bad about it.

1010
01:13:46,598 --> 01:13:49,032
What the fuck'd I tell ya?
Huh?

1011
01:13:49,101 --> 01:13:53,037
As soon as the word got out the fix was in, man,
the odds went through the roof.

1012
01:13:53,105 --> 01:13:55,300
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1013
01:13:55,374 --> 01:13:58,810
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was
a better boxer, he'd still be alive.

1014
01:13:58,877 --> 01:14:00,811
If he never
laced up his gloves,

1015
01:14:00,879 --> 01:14:03,313
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1016
01:14:05,384 --> 01:14:08,979
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1017
01:14:09,054 --> 01:14:11,989
Yeah, well, enough about the poor,
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1018
01:14:12,057 --> 01:14:15,754
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1019
01:14:15,827 --> 01:14:18,762
How many bookies did you
lay it around on?

1020
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:21,264
All eight?
How long to collect?

1021
01:14:22,901 --> 01:14:25,836
So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night? No, I understand.

1022
01:14:25,904 --> 01:14:29,067
A few stragglers aside.
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1023
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:31,371
That is great news, man.

1024
01:14:31,443 --> 01:14:35,641
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1025
01:14:35,714 --> 01:14:38,979
It'll probably take us
a couple days to get down to Knoxville.

1026
01:14:39,051 --> 01:14:40,985
Okay, my brother.

1027
01:14:41,053 --> 01:14:43,021
You're right.

1028
01:14:43,088 --> 01:14:45,420
You're goddamn right.

1029
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:48,982
All right, Scotty, next time I see you,
it'll be on Tennessee time.

1030
01:14:49,061 --> 01:14:51,393
Cool, brother.

1031
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:08,979
$45.60.

1032
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:14,485
And, uh,

1033
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:17,852
here's a little something
for the effort.

1034
01:15:17,923 --> 01:15:21,859
Now, if anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight, what are you gonna say?

1035
01:15:21,927 --> 01:15:23,861
The truth.

1036
01:15:23,929 --> 01:15:27,421
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1037
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:31,734
Bonsoir,
Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1038
01:15:31,803 --> 01:15:34,328
Buenas Noches, Butch.

1039
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:47,384
Whew.

1040
01:15:48,754 --> 01:15:50,745
Keep the light off.

1041
01:15:50,822 --> 01:15:53,757
- Is that better, Sugar Pop?
- Oui.

1042
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:00,164
Hard day at the office?

1043
01:16:00,232 --> 01:16:02,166
Pretty hard.

1044
01:16:02,234 --> 01:16:04,464
Got in a fight.

1045
01:16:04,536 --> 01:16:06,697
Poor baby.

1046
01:16:06,772 --> 01:16:09,332
Can you make spoons?

1047
01:16:09,408 --> 01:16:12,343
You know what?
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1048
01:16:12,411 --> 01:16:16,347
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
- I like the way you stink.

1049
01:16:16,415 --> 01:16:18,849
Let me take this jacket off.

1050
01:16:21,019 --> 01:16:24,546
- I was looking at myself in the mirror.
- Uh-huh.

1051
01:16:24,623 --> 01:16:26,557
I wish I had a pot.

1052
01:16:28,327 --> 01:16:32,263
You were looking at yourself in the mirror,
and you wish you had some pot?

1053
01:16:32,331 --> 01:16:35,266
A pot.
A pot belly.

1054
01:16:35,334 --> 01:16:37,495
Pot bellies are sexy.

1055
01:16:37,569 --> 01:16:39,867
Well, you should be happy,

1056
01:16:39,938 --> 01:16:41,872
'cause you have one.

1057
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:45,398
Shut up, fatso.
I don't have a pot.

1058
01:16:45,477 --> 01:16:49,345
I have a bit of a tummy,
like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."

1059
01:16:49,414 --> 01:16:51,348
It's not the same thing.

1060
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:55,352
I didn't know there was such a difference
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1061
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,354
The difference is huge.

1062
01:16:57,422 --> 01:17:00,858
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?

1063
01:17:00,926 --> 01:17:02,860
No.

1064
01:17:02,928 --> 01:17:07,365
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1065
01:17:07,432 --> 01:17:10,526
But on a woman
a pot belly's very sexy.

1066
01:17:10,602 --> 01:17:16,040
The rest of you is normal-- normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass--

1067
01:17:16,108 --> 01:17:20,169
but with a big,
perfectly round pot belly.

1068
01:17:20,245 --> 01:17:23,180
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1069
01:17:23,248 --> 01:17:25,182
to accentuate it.

1070
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,684
You think men
would find that attractive?

1071
01:17:27,753 --> 01:17:30,916
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1072
01:17:30,989 --> 01:17:34,447
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...

1073
01:17:34,526 --> 01:17:36,460
is seldom the same.

1074
01:17:39,865 --> 01:17:43,460
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.

1075
01:17:43,535 --> 01:17:46,470
- You'd punch me in the belly?
- Right in the belly.

1076
01:17:46,538 --> 01:17:48,472
Ohh! I'd smother you!

1077
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:52,476
I'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe!

1078
01:17:52,544 --> 01:17:54,478
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

1079
01:17:54,546 --> 01:17:56,514
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1080
01:18:00,018 --> 01:18:01,952
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1081
01:18:04,189 --> 01:18:06,623
Oh.

1082
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:11,995
Did you get everything?

1083
01:18:12,063 --> 01:18:15,055
- Yes, I did.
- Good job, Sugar Pop.

1084
01:18:15,133 --> 01:18:17,067
Did everything
go as planned?

1085
01:18:17,135 --> 01:18:19,865
You didn't listen to the-- Ow!

1086
01:18:19,938 --> 01:18:21,872
You didn't listen to the radio?

1087
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:25,239
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?

1088
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:27,608
I won, all right.

1089
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:30,648
- Are you still retiring?
- Sure am.

1090
01:18:30,715 --> 01:18:33,081
So it all worked out
in the finish.

1091
01:18:34,519 --> 01:18:37,955
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1092
01:18:45,897 --> 01:18:48,764
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

1093
01:18:50,335 --> 01:18:53,270
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

1094
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:58,275
But they won't find us,
will they?

1095
01:19:01,179 --> 01:19:04,114
Do you still want me
to go with you?

1096
01:19:05,684 --> 01:19:09,347
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance. It's--

1097
01:19:15,961 --> 01:19:18,327
Say it.

1098
01:19:18,396 --> 01:19:20,990
Fabienne,

1099
01:19:21,066 --> 01:19:24,194
I want you to be with me.

1100
01:19:24,269 --> 01:19:27,261
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

1101
01:19:29,407 --> 01:19:31,375
Do you love me?

1102
01:19:31,443 --> 01:19:33,434
Very, very much.

1103
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:41,710
- Butch.
- Yes?

1104
01:19:43,154 --> 01:19:45,748
Will you give me
oral pleasure?

1105
01:19:47,259 --> 01:19:49,193
Will you kiss it?

1106
01:19:51,129 --> 01:19:53,324
But you first.

1107
01:19:53,398 --> 01:19:56,231
- Okay.
- Okay.

1108
01:20:06,444 --> 01:20:08,742
Butch.

1109
01:20:08,813 --> 01:20:12,249
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.

1110
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:30,340
I think I cracked a rib.

1111
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:33,845
- Giving me oral pleasure?
- No, retard, from the fight.

1112
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:37,348
- Don't call me "retard."
- My name is Fabby.

1113
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:39,907
- My name is Fabienne!
- Stop it.

1114
01:20:39,985 --> 01:20:41,919
- Stop it!
- My name is Fabi--

1115
01:20:41,987 --> 01:20:44,922
Shut up, fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1116
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:48,084
Okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1117
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:51,095
I take it back.

1118
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:56,033
Will you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1119
01:20:56,101 --> 01:21:00,037
Oh, I like that. I like being called a tulip.

1120
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:02,539
"Tulip" is much better
than "mongoloid."

1121
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:05,542
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

1122
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:07,737
And I took it back.

1123
01:21:07,813 --> 01:21:09,906
Butch?

1124
01:21:09,981 --> 01:21:11,915
Yes, Lemon Pie?

1125
01:21:11,983 --> 01:21:15,419
- Where are we going to go?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

1126
01:21:15,487 --> 01:21:17,614
Wherever you want.

1127
01:21:17,689 --> 01:21:20,624
We're gonna get a lot
of money from this,

1128
01:21:20,692 --> 01:21:23,627
but it ain't gonna be
the kind of money...

1129
01:21:23,695 --> 01:21:26,630
that we can live like hogs
in the fathouse forever.

1130
01:21:26,698 --> 01:21:30,634
I was thinking maybe we could go
down someplace in the South Pacific.

1131
01:21:30,702 --> 01:21:34,138
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.

1132
01:21:34,206 --> 01:21:37,141
- If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?
- You betcha.

1133
01:21:37,209 --> 01:21:40,645
And if after a while you didn't
dig that, we could go someplace else.

1134
01:21:40,712 --> 01:21:42,646
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1135
01:21:42,714 --> 01:21:44,648
But I do not speak Spanish.

1136
01:21:44,716 --> 01:21:47,685
Well, you do not speak
Bora-Boran either.

1137
01:21:47,753 --> 01:21:49,721
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1138
01:21:49,788 --> 01:21:52,723
- ¿Donde esta el zapateria?
- What does that mean?

1139
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:54,725
Where is the shoe store?

1140
01:21:54,793 --> 01:21:56,727
- ¿Donde esta--
- Spit, please.

1141
01:21:58,797 --> 01:22:02,062
- ¿Donde esta el zapateria?
- Excellent pronunciation.

1142
01:22:02,134 --> 01:22:04,159
Mmm.

1143
01:22:04,236 --> 01:22:07,535
You'll be my little mamacita
in no time.

1144
01:22:07,606 --> 01:22:10,131
- ¿Que hora es?
- ¿Que hora es?

1145
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:12,369
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

1146
01:22:12,444 --> 01:22:15,072
Time for bed.

1147
01:22:15,147 --> 01:22:17,081
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1148
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:26,724
Butch?

1149
01:22:32,631 --> 01:22:34,565
Never mind.

1150
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,168
Aah!

1151
01:22:44,242 --> 01:22:48,303
Merde! You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?

1152
01:22:58,757 --> 01:23:03,023
- What is this you're watching?
- A motorcycle movie.

1153
01:23:03,094 --> 01:23:05,028
I'm not sure the name.

1154
01:23:06,932 --> 01:23:10,026
- Are you watching it?
- In a way.

1155
01:23:11,837 --> 01:23:15,933
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.

1156
01:23:18,777 --> 01:23:23,214
- What was it about?
- How should I know? You were the one watching it.

1157
01:23:23,281 --> 01:23:27,274
- No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
- I don't know.

1158
01:23:27,352 --> 01:23:29,286
I don't remember.

1159
01:23:29,354 --> 01:23:32,289
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1160
01:23:32,357 --> 01:23:35,326
Well, let's look
at the grumpy man in the morning.

1161
01:23:37,395 --> 01:23:40,330
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast.

1162
01:23:40,398 --> 01:23:43,026
One more kiss,
and I'll get up.

1163
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:48,401
- Satisfied?
- Yep.

1164
01:23:48,473 --> 01:23:51,909
- Get up, lazy bones!
- Ohh!

1165
01:23:51,977 --> 01:23:55,037
Ohh. God.

1166
01:23:56,348 --> 01:23:59,875
- What time is it?
- Almost nine in the morning.

1167
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:03,717
- What time does our train arrive?
- Eleven.

1168
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:08,157
- You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?
- What, Lemon Pie?

1169
01:24:08,226 --> 01:24:12,356
I'm gonna order a big plate
of blueberry pancakes...

1170
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:14,364
with maple syrup,

1171
01:24:14,432 --> 01:24:17,868
eggs over easy
and five sausages.

1172
01:24:17,936 --> 01:24:20,131
Anything to drink with that?

1173
01:24:20,205 --> 01:24:23,868
Wow, that looks nice.

1174
01:24:23,942 --> 01:24:27,275
To drink-- A tall glass
of orange juice...

1175
01:24:27,345 --> 01:24:29,779
and a black cup of coffee.

1176
01:24:29,848 --> 01:24:34,410
- After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.
- Pie for breakfast?

1177
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:38,422
Any time of the day is a good time for pie.

1178
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:41,425
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.

1179
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:44,485
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese.

1180
01:24:44,562 --> 01:24:46,496
Where's my watch?

1181
01:24:50,969 --> 01:24:53,233
It's there.

1182
01:24:53,305 --> 01:24:55,899
- No, it's not.
- Have you looked?

1183
01:24:55,974 --> 01:25:00,240
Yes, I've fuckin' looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?

1184
01:25:00,312 --> 01:25:02,439
You sure you got it?

1185
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:04,812
Yes.
Bedside table drawer.

1186
01:25:04,883 --> 01:25:08,046
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1187
01:25:08,119 --> 01:25:11,282
Yeah, well,
it's not here now.

1188
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:14,223
Well, it should be.

1189
01:25:14,292 --> 01:25:18,092
Yes, it most definitely should be,
but it's not here now! So where the fuck is it?

1190
01:25:23,668 --> 01:25:27,104
Fabienne,
where's my father's fucking watch?

1191
01:25:28,773 --> 01:25:33,210
Do you have any idea what he had
to go through to get me that watch?

1192
01:25:33,278 --> 01:25:36,213
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1193
01:25:36,281 --> 01:25:41,617
All this other shit you could've set
on fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget the fucking watch.

1194
01:25:41,686 --> 01:25:43,017
Now think.

1195
01:25:43,088 --> 01:25:46,615
- Did you get it?
- I believe so.

1196
01:25:46,691 --> 01:25:49,956
"You believe so"? What the fuck does that mean?
You either did or didn't get it.

1197
01:25:51,363 --> 01:25:53,297
Then I did.

1198
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:56,600
Are you sure?

1199
01:25:57,702 --> 01:25:59,636
No.

1200
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,674
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1201
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:06,108
Motherfucker!
Motherfuckin'--

1202
01:26:08,013 --> 01:26:10,811
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?

1203
01:26:10,882 --> 01:26:12,816
No!

1204
01:26:15,453 --> 01:26:17,387
It's not your fault.

1205
01:26:22,193 --> 01:26:24,627
You left it at the apartment.

1206
01:26:30,201 --> 01:26:33,637
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1207
01:26:35,707 --> 01:26:38,835
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.

1208
01:26:41,046 --> 01:26:42,980
I reminded you about it,

1209
01:26:43,048 --> 01:26:47,815
but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me.

1210
01:26:47,886 --> 01:26:51,913
If all I gave a fuck about was
the watch, I shoulda told you that.

1211
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:54,424
You're not a mind reader.

1212
01:26:54,492 --> 01:26:56,426
Are you?

1213
01:27:06,571 --> 01:27:08,505
I-- I'm sorry.

1214
01:27:08,573 --> 01:27:12,168
Don't be. Just means
I can't have breakfast with you.

1215
01:27:12,243 --> 01:27:14,939
Why does it mean that?

1216
01:27:17,515 --> 01:27:20,848
Because I gotta go back to my apartment
and get my watch.

1217
01:27:22,053 --> 01:27:24,578
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1218
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:28,922
Well, that's what
I'm gonna find out.

1219
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:32,224
If they are, and I don't think
I can handle it,

1220
01:27:32,297 --> 01:27:34,231
then I'll split.

1221
01:27:34,299 --> 01:27:38,599
I saw your watch. I thought
I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1222
01:27:43,875 --> 01:27:46,935
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.

1223
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:48,876
Have a nice breakfast.

1224
01:27:48,947 --> 01:27:52,383
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say "blueberry pie."

1225
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:54,884
Blueberry pie.

1226
01:27:54,953 --> 01:27:57,114
Maybe not that fast.

1227
01:27:57,188 --> 01:28:00,385
- But pretty fast. Okay?
- Okay.

1228
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:02,790
- Bye.
- Bye.

1229
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:05,796
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget,

1230
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:07,798
she forgets my father's watch!

1231
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:09,800
I specifically reminded her--

1232
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,995
bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1233
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:15,335
"Don't forget my father's watch."

1234
01:28:30,822 --> 01:28:34,258
Visit the
Jackrabbit Slim's nearest you...

1235
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:48,566
i EI burro!

1236
01:30:52,241 --> 01:30:54,175
Lookin' good, Butch.

1237
01:33:43,278 --> 01:33:45,337
Lf I were walkin'
in your shoes

1238
01:33:52,888 --> 01:33:58,326
Countin' flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all

1239
01:33:58,393 --> 01:34:02,830
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of fifty-one

1240
01:34:02,898 --> 01:34:05,833
That's how you're gonna
beat 'em, Butch.

1241
01:34:05,901 --> 01:34:09,132
- Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
- They keep underestimatin' ya.

1242
01:34:09,204 --> 01:34:11,138
Now don't tell me

1243
01:34:12,708 --> 01:34:16,166
Countin' flowers on the wall

1244
01:34:16,245 --> 01:34:19,703
That don't bother me at all

1245
01:34:19,781 --> 01:34:25,310
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of fifty-one

1246
01:34:25,387 --> 01:34:30,120
Smokin' cigarettes
and watchin' Captain Kangaroo

1247
01:34:30,192 --> 01:34:33,093
Now don't tell me

1248
01:34:33,162 --> 01:34:35,596
I've nothin' to do

1249
01:34:35,664 --> 01:34:37,962
It's good to see you
I must go

1250
01:34:38,033 --> 01:34:40,092
I know I look a fright

1251
01:34:40,169 --> 01:34:42,637
- Anyway my eyes
- Motherfucker.

1252
01:34:42,704 --> 01:34:45,070
- Are not accustomed--
- Uhh!

1253
01:34:53,248 --> 01:34:55,682
- Do you think he's dead?
- He's dead.

1254
01:34:55,751 --> 01:34:57,981
- Oh, my God.
- He's dead.

1255
01:35:07,863 --> 01:35:11,799
If you need someone to go to court,
I'll be glad to help. That guy was a drunken maniac.

1256
01:35:11,867 --> 01:35:14,802
He hit you, then he
crashed into that car.

1257
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:16,804
- Who?
- Him.

1258
01:35:20,876 --> 01:35:23,071
I'll be damned.

1259
01:35:34,289 --> 01:35:36,257
Ohh!

1260
01:35:38,727 --> 01:35:41,025
Aaaah! I'm shot!

1261
01:35:47,836 --> 01:35:51,237
Sally! Sally!

1262
01:35:54,743 --> 01:35:56,677
Aaah!

1263
01:35:59,014 --> 01:36:00,948
Motherfucker!

1264
01:36:03,585 --> 01:36:07,043
- Can I help you with somethin'?
- Shut the fuck up.

1265
01:36:07,122 --> 01:36:10,057
Now you just wait
a goddamn minute, now!

1266
01:36:10,125 --> 01:36:12,093
What the fuck you up to?

1267
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,788
Come here, motherfucker!

1268
01:36:14,863 --> 01:36:17,764
You feel that sting, huh, big boy?

1269
01:36:17,833 --> 01:36:19,767
That's pride
fuckin' with you, see?

1270
01:36:19,835 --> 01:36:23,271
You gotta fight through that shit!
Huh?

1271
01:36:23,338 --> 01:36:26,330
- You'd better kill me--
- Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.

1272
01:36:26,408 --> 01:36:28,968
Somebody's gonna get
their motherfuckin' head blown to--

1273
01:36:29,044 --> 01:36:31,569
Hold it right there, goddamn it.

1274
01:36:31,647 --> 01:36:35,413
- This ain't none of your business, mister.
- I'm makin' it my business.

1275
01:36:35,484 --> 01:36:38,214
- Toss the weapon.
- You don't understand, man.

1276
01:36:38,287 --> 01:36:40,312
Toss the weapon.

1277
01:36:42,391 --> 01:36:45,554
It's time

1278
01:36:45,627 --> 01:36:48,323
- To find love
- Take your foot off the nigger,

1279
01:36:48,397 --> 01:36:50,331
put your hand behind your head,

1280
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:52,458
approach the counter right now.

1281
01:36:52,534 --> 01:36:54,559
This motherfucker's trying to...

1282
01:36:54,636 --> 01:36:55,967
kill me.

1283
01:36:56,038 --> 01:36:59,804
Shut up.
Keep comin'. Come on.

1284
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:04,837
Lf love

1285
01:37:04,913 --> 01:37:06,847
ls shelter

1286
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:26,333
Zed. Maynard.

1287
01:37:27,502 --> 01:37:30,437
Yeah, the spider
just caught a couple flies.

1288
01:37:30,505 --> 01:37:33,941
Whoa, my angel

1289
01:37:36,511 --> 01:37:39,214
Down to you

1290
01:37:39,214 --> 01:37:39,646
Down to you

1291
01:38:18,275 --> 01:38:21,210
Nobody kills anybody
in my place of business...

1292
01:38:21,278 --> 01:38:24,213
except me or Zed.

1293
01:38:26,483 --> 01:38:28,417
That's Zed.

1294
01:38:41,065 --> 01:38:44,501
- I thought you said you waited for me.
- I did.

1295
01:38:48,806 --> 01:38:51,741
Then how come they're all beat up?

1296
01:38:51,809 --> 01:38:56,075
They did that to each other, man.
They came in fightin'.

1297
01:38:56,146 --> 01:39:00,480
Now, this 'un right here,
he was gonna shoot that one.

1298
01:39:00,551 --> 01:39:03,918
Is that right?
You gonna shoot him, boy?

1299
01:39:03,987 --> 01:39:06,581
Huh?

1300
01:39:08,592 --> 01:39:11,652
Hey, is Grace
all right out front?

1301
01:39:11,728 --> 01:39:14,959
- Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?
- No, it's Thursday.

1302
01:39:15,032 --> 01:39:17,626
- She oughta be fine.
- Mmm.

1303
01:39:19,103 --> 01:39:23,369
Well, bring out the Gimp.

1304
01:39:24,475 --> 01:39:27,205
I think the Gimp's sleepin'.

1305
01:39:27,277 --> 01:39:31,213
Then I guess you'll just have to go
wake him up now, won't you?

1306
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,254
Get up.

1307
01:40:25,536 --> 01:40:27,470
Get down.

1308
01:40:37,548 --> 01:40:40,483
Which one of 'em
you wanna do first?

1309
01:40:40,551 --> 01:40:44,282
I ain't for sure yet.

1310
01:40:47,824 --> 01:40:50,486
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo,

1311
01:40:50,561 --> 01:40:53,155
catch a nigger...

1312
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:55,824
by his toe.

1313
01:40:55,899 --> 01:40:59,665
If he hollers, let him go.

1314
01:40:59,736 --> 01:41:03,866
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

1315
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:09,777
My mother said...

1316
01:41:09,846 --> 01:41:13,441
pick the perfect one,

1317
01:41:13,517 --> 01:41:16,509
and... you... are...

1318
01:41:17,955 --> 01:41:19,889
it.

1319
01:41:22,226 --> 01:41:25,286
- Guess that means you, big boy.
- Fuck you!

1320
01:41:25,362 --> 01:41:27,830
Shh.

1321
01:41:29,633 --> 01:41:34,195
- You wanna do it in here?
- No, let's take him back to Russell's old room.

1322
01:41:34,271 --> 01:41:37,001
Sounds good to me.

1323
01:42:00,931 --> 01:42:04,025
You keep an eye on this 'un.

1324
01:42:29,993 --> 01:42:34,453
Yeah!

1325
01:42:37,034 --> 01:42:40,231
Now! Go! Come on, motherfucker!

1326
01:42:40,304 --> 01:42:43,740
Now, motherfucker! Aaah!

01:42:43,807 --> 01:42:48,244
Come on! Yeah!

1328
01:42:54,418 --> 01:42:57,512
Yeah!

1329
01:43:04,394 --> 01:43:06,385
- Ohh!
- Yeah!

1330
01:43:08,832 --> 01:43:12,268
Yeah! Yeah!

1331
01:43:13,770 --> 01:43:16,705
Yeee!
Yeeee-hah!

1332
01:43:37,361 --> 01:43:39,295
Yeah!

1333
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:10,690
Come on!
Get down there!

1334
01:44:13,330 --> 01:44:16,561
Aaah!
Do it! Yeah!

1335
01:44:33,683 --> 01:44:36,675
Yeah! Yeah!

1336
01:44:52,169 --> 01:44:55,605
Shut the fuck up!

1337
01:44:57,374 --> 01:44:59,308
Fuck him!

1338
01:45:01,478 --> 01:45:03,412
Come on!

1339
01:45:07,017 --> 01:45:10,453
Fuck him. Yeah.

1340
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:23,076
Aaaaah!

1341
01:45:27,614 --> 01:45:30,174
Aaaaah!

1342
01:45:41,194 --> 01:45:43,424
You want that gun,
don't ya, Zed?

1343
01:45:45,098 --> 01:45:47,032
Huh?

1344
01:45:48,034 --> 01:45:49,968
Go ahead and pick it up.

1345
01:45:52,372 --> 01:45:54,704
Go ahead. Pick it up.

1346
01:45:56,977 --> 01:45:59,468
Come on--
Thatta boy!

1347
01:46:01,047 --> 01:46:05,143
I want you to pick it up, Zed.

1348
01:46:09,389 --> 01:46:12,449
Step aside, Butch.

1349
01:46:24,704 --> 01:46:27,730
Fuck!

1350
01:46:30,343 --> 01:46:33,278
You okay?

1351
01:46:34,648 --> 01:46:36,809
No, man.

1352
01:46:36,883 --> 01:46:39,818
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1353
01:46:50,997 --> 01:46:53,932
What now?

1354
01:46:56,269 --> 01:46:58,203
"What now"?

1355
01:46:59,573 --> 01:47:03,009
Let me tell you what now.

1356
01:47:03,076 --> 01:47:06,011
I'm gonna call a couple of hard,
pipe-hittin' niggers...

1357
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:09,014
to go to work
on the homes here...

1358
01:47:09,082 --> 01:47:12,017
with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.

1359
01:47:13,987 --> 01:47:16,683
You hear me talkin',
hillbilly boy?

1360
01:47:17,958 --> 01:47:20,518
I ain't through with you
by a damn sight!

1361
01:47:20,594 --> 01:47:23,529
I'm gonna get medieval
on your ass.

1362
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,735
I meant what now
between me and you.

1363
01:47:34,808 --> 01:47:37,208
Oh, that "what now."

1364
01:47:38,645 --> 01:47:42,581
I tell you what now between me and you.

1365
01:47:44,150 --> 01:47:47,085
There is no me and you.

1366
01:47:48,521 --> 01:47:50,455
Not no more.

1367
01:47:53,526 --> 01:47:55,460
So, are we cool?

1368
01:47:56,830 --> 01:47:59,128
Yeah, we cool.

1369
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:01,326
Two things.

1370
01:48:03,103 --> 01:48:06,038
Don't tell nobody about this.

1371
01:48:07,507 --> 01:48:11,136
This shit is between me, you...

1372
01:48:11,211 --> 01:48:15,671
and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin'
The-Rest-Of-His-Short-Ass- Life-ln-Agonizing-Pain"...

1373
01:48:15,749 --> 01:48:17,683
rapist here.

1374
01:48:18,985 --> 01:48:21,749
It ain't nobody else's business.

1375
01:48:21,821 --> 01:48:23,755
Two:

1376
01:48:23,823 --> 01:48:27,315
You leave town tonight.
Right now.

1377
01:48:28,561 --> 01:48:30,495
And when you gone,

1378
01:48:30,563 --> 01:48:32,497
you stay gone,

1379
01:48:32,565 --> 01:48:35,500
or you be gone.

1380
01:48:35,568 --> 01:48:38,503
You lost all your L.A. privileges.
Deal?

1381
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:42,274
Deal.

1382
01:48:43,510 --> 01:48:45,444
Get your ass outta here.

1383
01:49:11,905 --> 01:49:14,155
Oh, shit.

1384
01:49:47,155 --> 01:49:49,589
Fabienne!

1385
01:49:50,658 --> 01:49:53,593
Fabienne!

1386
01:49:54,829 --> 01:49:56,922
Fabienne!
Come on, baby.

1387
01:49:56,998 --> 01:50:00,434
- Come on. Get your shit. We gotta go right now.
- I was so worried.

1388
01:50:00,501 --> 01:50:03,937
- What about our bags? - Fuck the bags;
if we don't split right now, we'll miss the train.

1389
01:50:04,005 --> 01:50:05,939
- I'll be downstairs.
- Is everything well?

1390
01:50:06,007 --> 01:50:09,943
- Just come on! No talking now!
- Are we in danger?

1391
01:50:13,448 --> 01:50:15,382
Come on, honey!

1392
01:50:17,452 --> 01:50:19,920
Where did you get
this motorcycle?

1393
01:50:19,988 --> 01:50:24,516
- It's not a motorcycle, baby. It's a chopper. Let's go.
- What happened to my Honda?

1394
01:50:24,592 --> 01:50:28,358
I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that Honda.
Will you come on now, please?

1395
01:50:28,429 --> 01:50:30,829
Come on. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1396
01:50:35,403 --> 01:50:38,839
- You're hurt?
- No, no, I might've broken my nose. It's no biggie.

1397
01:50:38,907 --> 01:50:41,842
Come on. Hop on.
Baby, please, we--

1398
01:50:41,910 --> 01:50:44,845
Honey, we gotta hit
the fuckin' road! Get on!

1399
01:50:46,514 --> 01:50:49,950
Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Come here, come here.

1400
01:50:50,018 --> 01:50:51,952
I'm sorry. Mmm.

1401
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:55,956
- I'm so sorry. - You were gone so long,
I started to think dreadful thoughts.

1402
01:50:56,024 --> 01:50:58,959
I didn't mean to worry you.
Everything's fine.

1403
01:50:59,027 --> 01:51:00,961
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

1404
01:51:01,029 --> 01:51:02,963
Did you get
the blueberry pancakes?

1405
01:51:03,031 --> 01:51:06,967
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get
buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?

1406
01:51:07,035 --> 01:51:09,970
Since I left you,
this has been, without a doubt,

1407
01:51:10,038 --> 01:51:13,269
the single weirdest fuckin' day of
my life-- I'll tell you all about it.

1408
01:51:13,341 --> 01:51:15,206
Gotta go. Come on.

1409
01:51:15,276 --> 01:51:18,040
Butch, whose motorcycle
is this?

1410
01:51:18,112 --> 01:51:20,706
- It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this?

1411
01:51:20,782 --> 01:51:22,716
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?

1412
01:51:22,784 --> 01:51:25,344
Zed's dead, baby.
Zed's dead.

1413
01:51:41,536 --> 01:51:43,834
Yes, you did, Brett!

1414
01:51:43,905 --> 01:51:47,432
You tried to fuck him,
and Marsellus Wallace don't liked to be fucked...

1415
01:51:47,508 --> 01:51:49,942
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1416
01:51:50,011 --> 01:51:53,105
- Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die.
- You read the Bible, Brett?

1417
01:51:53,181 --> 01:51:56,617
- Yes!
- Well, there's this passage I got memorized.

1418
01:51:56,684 --> 01:51:58,845
Sorta fits the occasion.

1419
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:02,219
Ezekiel 25:17.

1420
01:52:02,290 --> 01:52:06,590
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

1421
01:52:06,661 --> 01:52:08,595
by the inequities
of the selfish...

1422
01:52:08,663 --> 01:52:12,099
and the tyranny of evil men.

1423
01:52:12,166 --> 01:52:16,830
Blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will,

1424
01:52:16,904 --> 01:52:19,930
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

1425
01:52:20,008 --> 01:52:22,533
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

1426
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:25,340
and the finder
of lost children.

1427
01:52:25,413 --> 01:52:29,679
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...

1428
01:52:29,751 --> 01:52:31,912
and furious anger...

1429
01:52:31,986 --> 01:52:36,389
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

1430
01:52:36,457 --> 01:52:40,325
And you will know
My name is the Lord...

1431
01:52:40,395 --> 01:52:43,796
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee."

1432
01:52:51,873 --> 01:52:54,307
I'm fucked.
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1433
01:52:54,375 --> 01:52:57,310
- Ls he a friend of yours?
- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1434
01:52:57,378 --> 01:53:00,313
Hmm? Oh.
Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.

1435
01:53:00,381 --> 01:53:03,316
- Better tell him to shut up. He's gettin' on my nerves.
- Fuck.

1436
01:53:03,384 --> 01:53:06,581
Marvin. Marvin!
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1437
01:53:06,654 --> 01:53:10,818
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1438
01:53:38,986 --> 01:53:42,422
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1439
01:53:42,490 --> 01:53:45,357
Slip your mind? Did you forget
that someone was in there...

1440
01:53:45,426 --> 01:53:47,360
with a goddamn hand cannon?

1441
01:53:47,428 --> 01:53:51,364
You see the size of that gun he fired
at us? It was bigger than him.

1442
01:53:56,137 --> 01:53:58,833
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1443
01:53:58,906 --> 01:54:00,840
I know.
We was lucky.

1444
01:54:00,908 --> 01:54:04,036
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

1445
01:54:04,112 --> 01:54:08,310
- Yeah, maybe.
- This was divine intervention.

1446
01:54:08,382 --> 01:54:10,316
You know what
divine intervention is?

1447
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:18,124
I think so.

1448
01:54:18,192 --> 01:54:21,628
That means that God came down
from Heaven and stopped the bullets.

1449
01:54:21,696 --> 01:54:24,130
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1450
01:54:24,198 --> 01:54:27,167
God came down from Heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1451
01:54:28,402 --> 01:54:30,393
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.

1452
01:54:30,471 --> 01:54:32,905
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!

1453
01:54:32,974 --> 01:54:36,910
- What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle!
- Chill. This shit happens.

1454
01:54:36,978 --> 01:54:39,742
Wrong! Wrong.
This shit doesn't "just happen."

1455
01:54:39,814 --> 01:54:43,250
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion in a car...

1456
01:54:43,317 --> 01:54:45,751
or in a jailhouse
with the cops?

1457
01:54:45,820 --> 01:54:48,448
We should be fuckin' dead,
my friend!

1458
01:54:48,523 --> 01:54:52,755
What happened here was a miracle, and I
want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1459
01:54:52,827 --> 01:54:57,526
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?

1460
01:55:04,539 --> 01:55:07,906
Let's go, nigger!
Come on! Shit.

1461
01:55:09,786 --> 01:55:11,583
You ever seen that show Cops?

1462
01:55:11,654 --> 01:55:14,589
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on,

1463
01:55:14,657 --> 01:55:18,593
and he was talkin' about this gunfight he
had in the hallway with this guy, right?

1464
01:55:18,661 --> 01:55:22,119
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'
happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1465
01:55:22,198 --> 01:55:25,133
Okay? It was just
him and this guy.

1466
01:55:25,201 --> 01:55:28,534
I mean, you know, it's,
it's freaky, but it happens.

1467
01:55:28,604 --> 01:55:33,541
You wanna play blind man, go walk with the shepherd,
but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.

1468
01:55:33,609 --> 01:55:36,544
- What the fuck does that mean?
- It means that's it for me.

1469
01:55:36,612 --> 01:55:39,308
From here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.

1470
01:55:39,382 --> 01:55:41,543
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
- Don't blaspheme.

1471
01:55:41,617 --> 01:55:44,677
- I said, don't do that!
- Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us?

1472
01:55:44,754 --> 01:55:47,814
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today--
I'm through.

1473
01:55:47,890 --> 01:55:50,825
- Why don't you tell him at the same time why?
- Don't worry, I will.

1474
01:55:50,893 --> 01:55:54,886
- And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off.
- I don't give a damn if he does.

1475
01:55:54,964 --> 01:55:58,058
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

1476
01:55:58,134 --> 01:56:00,568
Man, I don't even
have an opinion.

1477
01:56:00,636 --> 01:56:04,868
You gotta have an opinion. You think
God came down from Heaven and stopped--

1478
01:56:04,941 --> 01:56:06,932
What the fuck's happenin'?

1479
01:56:07,009 --> 01:56:08,943
- Aw, shit, man!
- Aw, man!

1480
01:56:09,011 --> 01:56:11,946
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why the fuck'd you do that?

1481
01:56:12,014 --> 01:56:13,948
I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

1482
01:56:14,016 --> 01:56:16,951
- Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit in my time, but this--
- Chill out, man!

1483
01:56:17,019 --> 01:56:19,954
It was an accident. We probably
went over a bump or somethin'.

1484
01:56:20,022 --> 01:56:21,956
The car ain't hit
no motherfuckin' bump.

1485
01:56:22,024 --> 01:56:25,357
I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1486
01:56:25,428 --> 01:56:28,864
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on
a city street in broad daylight here!

1487
01:56:28,931 --> 01:56:31,866
- I don't believe it!
- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!

1488
01:56:31,934 --> 01:56:35,392
We gotta get this car off the road.
Cops notice shit like a car drenched in blood.

1489
01:56:35,471 --> 01:56:38,406
- Just take it to a friendly place, that's all!
- This is the Valley, Vincent.

1490
01:56:38,474 --> 01:56:40,908
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places in the Valley.

1491
01:56:40,977 --> 01:56:43,912
- Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man!
- Shit!

1492
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:46,915
- What you doing?
- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1493
01:56:46,983 --> 01:56:50,510
- Where's Toluca Lake?
- Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1494
01:56:50,586 --> 01:56:53,521
If Jimmie's ass ain't home,
I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,

1495
01:56:53,589 --> 01:56:56,524
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1496
01:56:56,592 --> 01:56:59,527
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1497
01:56:59,595 --> 01:57:03,531
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we
gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1498
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:05,794
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1499
01:57:07,303 --> 01:57:10,238
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

1500
01:57:10,306 --> 01:57:13,935
He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.

1501
01:57:14,010 --> 01:57:16,945
- If he does, what do we do?
- We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls,

1502
01:57:17,013 --> 01:57:19,948
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch-- Jimmie's a friend.

1503
01:57:20,016 --> 01:57:22,951
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

1504
01:57:23,019 --> 01:57:24,953
Just tell him
not to be abusive.

1505
01:57:25,021 --> 01:57:26,955
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1506
01:57:27,023 --> 01:57:30,186
Put yourself in his position-- It's 8:00 in the morning,
he just woke up.

1507
01:57:30,259 --> 01:57:32,193
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1508
01:57:32,261 --> 01:57:35,196
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1509
01:57:35,264 --> 01:57:39,200
If that favor means I gotta take shit,
he can stick that favor straight up his ass.

1510
01:57:39,268 --> 01:57:43,204
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do
to his towel, man? - I was dryin' my hands!

1511
01:57:43,272 --> 01:57:46,207
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.

1512
01:57:46,275 --> 01:57:49,836
- I watched you get 'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.

1513
01:57:49,912 --> 01:57:51,846
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1514
01:57:51,914 --> 01:57:53,848
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did,

1515
01:57:53,916 --> 01:57:56,851
and when I finished, the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1516
01:57:56,919 --> 01:57:59,854
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

1517
01:57:59,922 --> 01:58:04,018
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man!

1518
01:58:04,093 --> 01:58:07,529
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?

1519
01:58:07,597 --> 01:58:12,057
You know I respect you and all.
But just don't put me in this position, all right?

1520
01:58:12,134 --> 01:58:14,830
All right.
Fine. Fine.

1521
01:58:14,904 --> 01:58:17,839
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

1522
01:58:17,907 --> 01:58:20,842
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1523
01:58:22,578 --> 01:58:25,445
Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!

1524
01:58:25,515 --> 01:58:27,608
This some serious
gourmet shit.

1525
01:58:27,683 --> 01:58:29,617
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...

1526
01:58:29,685 --> 01:58:31,653
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice.

1527
01:58:31,721 --> 01:58:33,655
Right?

1528
01:58:33,723 --> 01:58:36,658
And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

1529
01:58:36,726 --> 01:58:38,785
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.

1530
01:58:38,861 --> 01:58:42,888
- What? - I don't need you to tell
me how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1531
01:58:42,965 --> 01:58:45,456
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1532
01:58:45,535 --> 01:58:47,469
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

1533
01:58:47,537 --> 01:58:51,166
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1534
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:55,176
But you know what's on my mind right now?
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1535
01:58:55,244 --> 01:58:57,405
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

1536
01:58:57,480 --> 01:59:00,916
- Jimmie, don't even worry-- - Don't tell me
about anything. I wanna ask you a question.

1537
01:59:00,983 --> 01:59:02,917
When you came pulling in here,

1538
01:59:02,985 --> 01:59:06,182
did you notice the sign on the front of my
house that said, "Dead Nigger Storage"?

1539
01:59:06,255 --> 01:59:09,691
- You know I ain't seen no--
- Did you notice the sign on the front of my house...

1540
01:59:09,759 --> 01:59:11,693
that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

1541
01:59:11,761 --> 01:59:14,491
No. I didn't.

1542
01:59:14,564 --> 01:59:17,499
- You know why you didn't see that sign?
- Why?

1543
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:22,095
'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead
niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!

1544
01:59:22,171 --> 01:59:25,106
- We're not gonna store the motherfucker--
- Don't you fuckin' realize...

1545
01:59:25,174 --> 01:59:29,611
that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead
body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?

1546
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:32,910
No marriage counselor. No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1547
01:59:32,982 --> 01:59:36,349
Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!

1548
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:41,413
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1549
01:59:41,490 --> 01:59:43,583
Jimmie, Jimmie,
she ain't gonna leave you.

1550
01:59:43,659 --> 01:59:47,595
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!
Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.

1551
01:59:47,663 --> 01:59:51,622
There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna
make me forget I love my wife. Is there?

1552
01:59:54,770 --> 01:59:59,434
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1553
01:59:59,508 --> 02:00:02,568
The graveyard shift
at the hospital.

1554
02:00:02,645 --> 02:00:05,705
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1555
02:00:05,781 --> 02:00:09,717
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1556
02:00:09,785 --> 02:00:12,720
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1557
02:00:12,788 --> 02:00:15,757
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.

1558
02:00:15,825 --> 02:00:18,760
You're fucking my shit up
right now!

1559
02:00:18,828 --> 02:00:21,922
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

1560
02:00:21,998 --> 02:00:25,490
Do me that favor, all right?
The phone is in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.

1561
02:00:25,568 --> 02:00:28,503
Well, say she comes home.

1562
02:00:28,571 --> 02:00:31,005
What do you think she'll do?

1563
02:00:32,508 --> 02:00:34,942
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1564
02:00:35,011 --> 02:00:37,206
That ain't no kinda answer.

1565
02:00:37,279 --> 02:00:40,339
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1566
02:00:40,416 --> 02:00:43,283
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

1567
02:00:43,352 --> 02:00:45,286
this Bonnie situation is.

1568
02:00:45,354 --> 02:00:49,290
She comes home from a hard day's work,
finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...

1569
02:00:49,358 --> 02:00:51,292
doing a bunch of gangster shit,

1570
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:54,420
there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.

1571
02:00:56,599 --> 02:00:58,533
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

1572
02:00:58,601 --> 02:01:01,195
All I'm doing is
contemplating the ifs.

1573
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:04,205
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!

1574
02:01:04,273 --> 02:01:08,209
All I want to hear from your ass is, "You ain't
got no problem, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.

1575
02:01:08,277 --> 02:01:12,441
Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry,
which should be coming directly."

1576
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:15,678
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1577
02:01:15,751 --> 02:01:17,878
I'm on the motherfucker.

1578
02:01:17,953 --> 02:01:23,016
Chill them niggers out and wait for
the Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1579
02:01:23,092 --> 02:01:25,526
You sendin' the Wolf?

1580
02:01:25,594 --> 02:01:27,789
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

1581
02:01:27,863 --> 02:01:30,127
Shit, yeah, negro!

1582
02:01:30,199 --> 02:01:33,327
That's all you had to say!

1583
02:01:33,402 --> 02:01:36,599
She the hysterical type?

1584
02:01:36,672 --> 02:01:39,607
When is she due?

1585
02:01:39,675 --> 02:01:41,768
Mm-hmm.

1586
02:01:41,844 --> 02:01:43,778
Give me
the principals' names again.

1587
02:01:43,846 --> 02:01:45,780
Place your bets.

1588
02:01:46,849 --> 02:01:50,512
- Jules. Mm-hmm.
- Cards, please.

1589
02:01:50,586 --> 02:01:52,520
Vincent.

1590
02:01:57,259 --> 02:01:59,193
Jimmie.

1591
02:02:00,429 --> 02:02:02,556
Bonnie. Mm-hmm.

1592
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:11,067
It's thirty minutes away.
I'll be there in ten.

1593
02:02:27,884 --> 02:02:30,819
You're... Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

1594
02:02:30,887 --> 02:02:34,516
- It sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1595
02:02:34,591 --> 02:02:37,526
- Good. We got one.
- So I heard. May I come in?

1596
02:02:37,594 --> 02:02:39,528
Uh, yeah. Please do.

1597
02:02:39,596 --> 02:02:43,259
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.

1598
02:02:43,333 --> 02:02:45,767
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1599
02:02:45,835 --> 02:02:48,770
If I was informed correctly, the clock
is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?

1600
02:02:48,838 --> 02:02:50,772
Uh, one hundred percent.

1601
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:54,776
- Your wife Bonnie comes home at
9:30 in the a.m., correct? - Uh-huh.

1602
02:02:54,844 --> 02:02:59,338
I was led to believe if she comes home and
finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1603
02:02:59,415 --> 02:03:03,715
- She wouldn't at that.
- That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1604
02:03:03,787 --> 02:03:07,223
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

1605
02:03:07,290 --> 02:03:11,624
Now, you got a corpse in a car,
minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.

1606
02:03:19,369 --> 02:03:21,303
- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

1607
02:03:21,371 --> 02:03:24,807
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1608
02:03:24,874 --> 02:03:28,310
- Would you make me a cup?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

1609
02:03:29,779 --> 02:03:32,714
Oh, uh, um,
how do you take it?

1610
02:03:32,782 --> 02:03:35,342
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1611
02:03:37,420 --> 02:03:40,856
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1612
02:03:40,924 --> 02:03:44,360
Does it smoke? Does it make
a lot of noise? Ls there gas in it?

1613
02:03:44,427 --> 02:03:47,863
- Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
- Positive?

1614
02:03:47,931 --> 02:03:51,367
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1615
02:03:51,434 --> 02:03:55,495
- As far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.

1616
02:03:55,572 --> 02:03:57,597
Let's go back
to the kitchen.

1617
02:04:03,246 --> 02:04:06,181
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1618
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:12,954
Mmm.

1619
02:04:14,023 --> 02:04:16,150
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1620
02:04:16,226 --> 02:04:19,161
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1621
02:04:19,229 --> 02:04:21,959
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1622
02:04:22,031 --> 02:04:25,967
- That would lead me to believe you got
cleansers and shit. - Yeah. Under the sink.

1623
02:04:26,035 --> 02:04:29,471
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

1624
02:04:29,539 --> 02:04:33,566
and clean the inside of the car--
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1625
02:04:33,643 --> 02:04:37,579
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1626
02:04:37,647 --> 02:04:40,582
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1627
02:04:40,650 --> 02:04:43,585
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1628
02:04:43,653 --> 02:04:48,022
Just give it a good once-over. What you need
to take care of are the really messy parts.

1629
02:04:48,091 --> 02:04:52,187
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1630
02:04:52,262 --> 02:04:54,696
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1631
02:04:54,764 --> 02:04:57,699
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1632
02:04:57,767 --> 02:05:01,396
The thicker the better, the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1633
02:05:01,471 --> 02:05:06,773
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1634
02:05:06,843 --> 02:05:08,777
with quilts and blankets,

1635
02:05:08,845 --> 02:05:12,781
so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout in the car,
the subterfuge won't last,

1636
02:05:12,849 --> 02:05:15,716
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1637
02:05:15,785 --> 02:05:17,844
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1638
02:05:17,921 --> 02:05:19,684
"Please" would be nice.

1639
02:05:21,157 --> 02:05:24,092
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1640
02:05:25,995 --> 02:05:29,829
Get it straight, buster. I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1641
02:05:31,634 --> 02:05:34,569
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1642
02:05:34,637 --> 02:05:37,071
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1643
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:41,042
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1644
02:05:41,110 --> 02:05:44,443
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1645
02:05:44,514 --> 02:05:47,449
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1646
02:05:47,517 --> 02:05:50,315
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1647
02:05:50,386 --> 02:05:53,446
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1648
02:05:53,523 --> 02:05:58,153
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys
to act fast if you wanna get out of this.

1649
02:05:58,227 --> 02:06:01,663
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

1650
02:06:06,169 --> 02:06:09,832
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

1651
02:06:12,542 --> 02:06:15,238
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1652
02:06:17,313 --> 02:06:19,247
Green.

1653
02:06:20,850 --> 02:06:23,785
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1654
02:06:25,989 --> 02:06:28,423
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1655
02:06:29,926 --> 02:06:31,860
Nobody who'll be missed.

1656
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:36,865
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1657
02:06:37,967 --> 02:06:39,901
- How we comin', Jimmie?
- Pretty good.

1658
02:06:39,969 --> 02:06:43,132
I got it all here, but, uh,

1659
02:06:43,206 --> 02:06:46,642
- Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.
- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1660
02:06:46,709 --> 02:06:50,236
Okay. You gotta
understand something, uh, Winston.

1661
02:06:50,313 --> 02:06:52,247
Uh-- Uh, no,
thank you.

1662
02:06:52,315 --> 02:06:55,443
Uh, this is
our best linen here,

1663
02:06:55,518 --> 02:06:58,453
and it's, uh--
it was a wedding present...

1664
02:06:58,521 --> 02:07:00,955
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1665
02:07:01,024 --> 02:07:05,461
- They're not with us anymore. I wanna help--
- Let me ask you a question.

1666
02:07:05,528 --> 02:07:08,463
- If you don't mind.
- No, no, please. Go ahead.

1667
02:07:10,033 --> 02:07:14,936
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,
were they millionaires?

1668
02:07:16,072 --> 02:07:18,006
No.

1669
02:07:18,074 --> 02:07:20,508
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1670
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:24,034
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1671
02:07:24,113 --> 02:07:26,547
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here,

1672
02:07:26,616 --> 02:07:30,882
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1673
02:07:30,953 --> 02:07:34,081
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1674
02:07:38,061 --> 02:07:41,997
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1675
02:07:43,132 --> 02:07:45,066
How about you, Jimmie?

1676
02:07:46,302 --> 02:07:48,236
You an oak man?

1677
02:07:49,338 --> 02:07:51,272
Oak's nice.

1678
02:07:57,113 --> 02:08:00,981
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1679
02:08:01,050 --> 02:08:03,484
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1680
02:08:03,553 --> 02:08:06,989
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he is wrong...

1681
02:08:07,056 --> 02:08:09,991
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

1682
02:08:10,059 --> 02:08:12,994
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

1683
02:08:13,062 --> 02:08:15,929
The motherfucker that said that shit never
had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1684
02:08:15,998 --> 02:08:19,764
- on account of your dumb ass.
- I got a threshold, Jules, for the abuse that I will take.

1685
02:08:19,836 --> 02:08:23,431
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1686
02:08:23,506 --> 02:08:26,942
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1687
02:08:27,009 --> 02:08:28,943
That's all.
I could blow.

1688
02:08:29,011 --> 02:08:30,945
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah.

1689
02:08:31,013 --> 02:08:33,948
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1690
02:08:34,016 --> 02:08:36,951
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1691
02:08:37,019 --> 02:08:38,953
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1692
02:08:39,021 --> 02:08:41,956
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1693
02:08:42,024 --> 02:08:45,255
You're the motherfucker should be on
brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'.

1694
02:08:45,328 --> 02:08:47,762
I'm washin' windows, and you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1695
02:08:57,540 --> 02:08:59,474
Fine job, gentlemen.

1696
02:09:00,810 --> 02:09:03,244
You may get out of this yet.

1697
02:09:03,312 --> 02:09:05,746
I can't believe
this is the same car.

1698
02:09:05,815 --> 02:09:09,251
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1699
02:09:09,318 --> 02:09:12,754
Phase one is complete-- Clean the car--
which moves us right along to Phase two:

1700
02:09:12,822 --> 02:09:14,756
Clean you two.

1701
02:09:16,325 --> 02:09:18,190
Strip.

1702
02:09:18,261 --> 02:09:22,027
- All the way?
- To your bare ass.

1703
02:09:22,098 --> 02:09:25,192
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1704
02:09:25,268 --> 02:09:28,203
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1705
02:09:28,271 --> 02:09:30,762
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1706
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:32,793
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

1707
02:09:32,927 --> 02:09:35,225
- You know what you two look like?
- What?

1708
02:09:35,296 --> 02:09:38,732
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

1709
02:09:38,799 --> 02:09:42,166
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1710
02:09:46,474 --> 02:09:48,942
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1711
02:09:49,009 --> 02:09:53,446
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit
out front for the garbageman to pick up.

1712
02:09:53,514 --> 02:09:57,746
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1713
02:09:59,186 --> 02:10:01,120
- Vincent.
- Okay, gentlemen.

1714
02:10:01,188 --> 02:10:04,680
You both been to County before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

1715
02:10:04,758 --> 02:10:07,693
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!

1716
02:10:07,761 --> 02:10:10,992
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1717
02:10:11,065 --> 02:10:14,000
Don't be afraid of the soap. Spread it around.

1718
02:10:14,068 --> 02:10:16,935
- Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair!

1719
02:10:17,004 --> 02:10:19,905
- Come on. Do it, goddamn it! Do it!
- Uh, um--

1720
02:10:20,975 --> 02:10:22,909
Towel.

1721
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:36,583
You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1722
02:10:36,657 --> 02:10:39,922
Perfect.

1723
02:10:39,994 --> 02:10:43,452
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1724
02:10:43,531 --> 02:10:45,465
You guys look like--

1725
02:10:45,533 --> 02:10:47,967
What do they look like,
Jimmie?

1726
02:10:48,035 --> 02:10:51,630
Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.

1727
02:10:51,705 --> 02:10:55,197
Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker.

1728
02:10:55,276 --> 02:10:58,006
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way right into prison.

1729
02:10:58,078 --> 02:11:00,012
Don't make me beg.

1730
02:11:03,083 --> 02:11:06,519
Okay, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

1731
02:11:06,587 --> 02:11:10,148
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1732
02:11:10,224 --> 02:11:13,159
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1733
02:11:13,227 --> 02:11:15,127
The place is North Hollywood,

1734
02:11:15,195 --> 02:11:19,188
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1735
02:11:19,266 --> 02:11:22,599
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1736
02:11:24,004 --> 02:11:25,938
Vincent, you follow
in my Acura.

1737
02:11:26,006 --> 02:11:29,942
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws,

1738
02:11:30,010 --> 02:11:33,104
- nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something.
- Right.

1739
02:11:33,180 --> 02:11:36,115
- What did I say?
- Don't do shit unless.

1740
02:11:36,183 --> 02:11:38,447
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

1741
02:11:38,519 --> 02:11:40,953
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1742
02:11:41,021 --> 02:11:44,457
How about you, Lash LaRue?
Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?

1743
02:11:44,525 --> 02:11:48,621
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool. I promise you.

1744
02:11:48,696 --> 02:11:51,631
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1745
02:11:51,699 --> 02:11:54,190
If get my car back
any different than I gave it,

1746
02:11:54,268 --> 02:11:57,203
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1747
02:12:01,041 --> 02:12:02,736
Outta my way, Rex.

1748
02:12:04,311 --> 02:12:06,745
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

1749
02:12:06,814 --> 02:12:10,580
- All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

1750
02:12:10,651 --> 02:12:13,279
Someday all this will be hers.

1751
02:12:13,354 --> 02:12:16,221
Hi. So, what's
with the outfits?

1752
02:12:16,290 --> 02:12:19,726
You guys going to a volleyball game or something?

1753
02:12:19,793 --> 02:12:22,227
I'm takin' milady
out for breakfast.

1754
02:12:22,296 --> 02:12:25,060
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

1755
02:12:25,132 --> 02:12:26,497
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1756
02:12:26,567 --> 02:12:30,003
It's--
It's your future. I--

1757
02:12:30,070 --> 02:12:32,834
I see a--
a cab ride.

1758
02:12:32,906 --> 02:12:35,875
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.

1759
02:12:35,943 --> 02:12:38,878
- Good night, Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.

1760
02:12:38,946 --> 02:12:41,380
Stay outta trouble,
you crazy kids.

1761
02:12:41,448 --> 02:12:45,384
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.

1762
02:12:45,452 --> 02:12:48,387
Yeah, really.
And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1763
02:12:48,455 --> 02:12:50,389
Call me Winston.

1764
02:12:51,959 --> 02:12:54,894
You see that, young lady? Respect.

1765
02:12:54,962 --> 02:12:59,160
- Respect for one's elders shows character.
- I have character.

1766
02:12:59,233 --> 02:13:03,260
Because you are a character doesn't
mean that you have character. -

1767
02:13:09,843 --> 02:13:12,778
Wanna share a cab?

1768
02:13:12,846 --> 02:13:17,112
I'd go for some breakfast.
Feel like havin' breakfast with me? -

1769
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:19,982
Cool.

1770
02:13:24,024 --> 02:13:27,118
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.

1771
02:13:27,194 --> 02:13:30,630
- Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob.
- I know that now.

1772
02:13:30,698 --> 02:13:33,132
- But was he cool or what?
- Thank you.

1773
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:35,634
Totally fuckin' cool,
in control.

1774
02:13:35,703 --> 02:13:39,764
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1775
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:42,434
Want some bacon?

1776
02:13:42,509 --> 02:13:44,443
No, man, I don't eat pork.

1777
02:13:44,511 --> 02:13:47,947
- Are you Jewish?
- I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all.

1778
02:13:48,015 --> 02:13:50,950
- Why not?
- Pigs are filthy animals.

1779
02:13:51,018 --> 02:13:52,952
I don't eat filthy animals.

1780
02:13:53,020 --> 02:13:56,456
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.

1781
02:13:56,523 --> 02:13:59,458
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,
but I'd never know...

1782
02:13:59,526 --> 02:14:02,461
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

1783
02:14:02,529 --> 02:14:05,464
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1784
02:14:05,532 --> 02:14:09,468
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got
sense enough to disregard its own feces.

1785
02:14:09,536 --> 02:14:13,870
- What about a dog? Dog eats its own feces.
- I don't eat dog either.

1786
02:14:13,941 --> 02:14:17,274
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?

1787
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:20,279
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,

1788
02:14:20,347 --> 02:14:22,281
but they're definitely dirty.

1789
02:14:22,349 --> 02:14:26,479
- But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way. - Ah, so, by that rationale,

1790
02:14:26,553 --> 02:14:30,114
if a pig had a better personality,
he would cease to be a filthy animal.

1791
02:14:30,190 --> 02:14:34,126
- Is that true? - We'd have to be talkin'
about one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1792
02:14:34,194 --> 02:14:38,221
I mean, he'd have to be ten times more
charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.

1793
02:14:43,837 --> 02:14:45,964
Oh, man, that's good.

1794
02:14:46,039 --> 02:14:49,634
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

1795
02:14:49,710 --> 02:14:52,702
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.

1796
02:14:52,780 --> 02:14:55,214
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
- About what?

1797
02:14:55,282 --> 02:14:58,217
- About the miracle we witnessed.
- Miracle you witnessed.

1798
02:14:58,285 --> 02:15:01,550
- I witnessed a freak occurrence.
- What is a miracle, Vincent?

1799
02:15:03,457 --> 02:15:06,654
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God?

1800
02:15:10,130 --> 02:15:13,964
When, um, God makes
the impossible possible.

1801
02:15:15,002 --> 02:15:16,936
But this morning...

1802
02:15:17,004 --> 02:15:19,734
- I don't think qualifies.
- Hey, Vincent.

1803
02:15:19,807 --> 02:15:23,504
See, that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1804
02:15:23,577 --> 02:15:28,514
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.

1805
02:15:28,582 --> 02:15:31,574
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

1806
02:15:31,652 --> 02:15:34,086
Now, whether or not
what we experienced...

1807
02:15:34,154 --> 02:15:37,317
was an according-to-Hoyle miracle
is insignificant.

1808
02:15:37,391 --> 02:15:41,157
But what is significant is,
I felt the touch of God.

1809
02:15:41,228 --> 02:15:43,162
God got involved.

1810
02:15:43,230 --> 02:15:44,959
But why?

1811
02:15:45,032 --> 02:15:48,058
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:
I don't know why.

1812
02:15:48,135 --> 02:15:51,104
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.

1813
02:15:51,171 --> 02:15:53,105
You're really thinkin'
about quittin'.

1814
02:15:53,173 --> 02:15:55,835
- For life? Most definitely.
- Yeah.

1815
02:15:55,909 --> 02:15:59,276
Fuck.
What you gonna do then?

1816
02:16:00,581 --> 02:16:04,813
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

1817
02:16:04,885 --> 02:16:08,480
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.

1818
02:16:08,555 --> 02:16:11,649
Then, basically, I'm just
gonna walk the Earth.

1819
02:16:11,725 --> 02:16:15,161
- What you mean, "walk the Earth"?
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.

1820
02:16:15,229 --> 02:16:18,198
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

1821
02:16:18,265 --> 02:16:20,529
And how long do you intend
to walk the Earth?

1822
02:16:20,601 --> 02:16:23,900
- 'Til God puts me where He wants me to be.
- What if He don't do that?

1823
02:16:23,971 --> 02:16:28,908
- If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.
- So you decided to be a bum.

1824
02:16:28,976 --> 02:16:32,639
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.

1825
02:16:32,713 --> 02:16:34,681
No, Jules,
you decided to be a bum,

1826
02:16:34,748 --> 02:16:38,047
just like all those pieces of shit
out there who beg for change,

1827
02:16:38,118 --> 02:16:41,053
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

1828
02:16:41,121 --> 02:16:44,090
They got a name for that, Jules.
It's called a bum.

1829
02:16:44,157 --> 02:16:47,820
And without a job, a residence or legal tender,
that's what you're gonna be, man.

1830
02:16:47,895 --> 02:16:49,829
You're gonna be
a fuckin' bum.

1831
02:16:49,897 --> 02:16:52,832
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.

1832
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:55,733
Garçon! Coffee!

1833
02:16:55,802 --> 02:17:00,296
Jules, look, what happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.

1834
02:17:00,374 --> 02:17:03,502
- But water into wine, l--
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1835
02:17:03,577 --> 02:17:06,671
- Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you,

1836
02:17:06,747 --> 02:17:09,341
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

1837
02:17:12,219 --> 02:17:14,153
I'm gonna take a shit.

1838
02:17:17,024 --> 02:17:20,773
Let me ask you something.

1839
02:17:20,907 --> 02:17:23,034
When did you make this decision?
When you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?

1840
02:17:23,109 --> 02:17:27,045
Yeah. I was sittin' here
eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,

1841
02:17:27,113 --> 02:17:29,047
replayin' the incident
in my head,

1842
02:17:29,115 --> 02:17:32,915
when I had what alcoholics refer to
as a moment of clarity.

1843
02:17:32,985 --> 02:17:36,113
Fuck. To be continued.

1844
02:17:48,134 --> 02:17:51,069
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

1845
02:17:52,672 --> 02:17:55,607
Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

1846
02:17:55,675 --> 02:18:00,669
Any one of you fucking pricks move,
and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!

1847
02:18:00,746 --> 02:18:04,147
- You got that? You just be quiet over there!
- Waitresses on the floor!

1848
02:18:04,217 --> 02:18:07,277
Get on the fuckin'--
Get the fuck down!

1849
02:18:07,353 --> 02:18:12,086
You're in a blind spot. Take your dames
over to that booth, on the count of ten!

1850
02:18:12,158 --> 02:18:16,720
- Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8--

1851
02:18:16,796 --> 02:18:19,890
What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking yuppie? Get down!

1852
02:18:19,966 --> 02:18:22,434
- Get down!
- Throw those bags!

1853
02:18:22,502 --> 02:18:24,993
Fucking move! Move!

1854
02:18:25,071 --> 02:18:27,335
Move! Get the fuck--

1855
02:18:27,406 --> 02:18:30,432
Get down on the fucking floor!

1856
02:18:30,510 --> 02:18:32,444
Grandpa! Down!

1857
02:18:32,512 --> 02:18:35,879
I'm the manager here, and there's
no problem. No problem at all.

1858
02:18:35,948 --> 02:18:38,883
- You gonna give me a problem?
- No, sir, I'm not.

1859
02:18:38,951 --> 02:18:42,978
Thought you said you were gonna
give me a fucking problem!

1860
02:18:43,055 --> 02:18:47,754
- I think we got a hero here, Honey Bunny.
- Well, just execute him!

1861
02:18:47,827 --> 02:18:49,761
I am not a hero.

1862
02:18:49,829 --> 02:18:52,855
- I'm just a coffee shop manager.
- Get the fuck down!

1863
02:18:52,932 --> 02:18:54,695
The restaurant's ours!

1864
02:18:54,767 --> 02:18:57,702
Just take whatever you want.

1865
02:18:57,770 --> 02:18:59,704
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

1866
02:18:59,772 --> 02:19:02,900
You tell them to be fucking cool
and everything will be over.

1867
02:19:02,975 --> 02:19:04,943
- You understand me?
- Yes!

1868
02:19:07,246 --> 02:19:09,043
Listen, everybody.

1869
02:19:09,115 --> 02:19:11,140
Be calm, cooperate,

1870
02:19:11,217 --> 02:19:14,152
and this'll all be over
in a minute!

1871
02:19:14,220 --> 02:19:16,188
Get the fuck down!
Well done.

1872
02:19:28,534 --> 02:19:31,970
All right, now, people, gonna
come around and collect your wallets!

1873
02:19:32,038 --> 02:19:35,496
You don't fucking talk. You just
throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?

1874
02:19:35,575 --> 02:19:37,805
I said, are we fucking clear?

1875
02:19:37,877 --> 02:19:40,812
Good!
Now, wallets out!

1876
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:44,475
That's it.
Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1877
02:19:44,550 --> 02:19:47,485
- In the fucking bag!
- I don't have nothin' on me, man.

1878
02:19:47,553 --> 02:19:49,418
In the bag.

1879
02:19:49,488 --> 02:19:52,423
What am I waiting for?
Ln the fucking bag.

1880
02:19:52,491 --> 02:19:55,426
Laura. Laura. Tips.
In the bag.

1881
02:19:55,494 --> 02:19:57,724
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

1882
02:19:57,797 --> 02:19:59,731
In the fucking bag.

1883
02:20:01,300 --> 02:20:04,758
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1884
02:20:04,837 --> 02:20:07,271
In the bag.
In the bag.

1885
02:20:19,452 --> 02:20:21,386
In the bag.

1886
02:20:36,502 --> 02:20:39,437
- What's in the case?
- My boss's dirty laundry.

1887
02:20:39,505 --> 02:20:42,030
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- When he wants it clean.

1888
02:20:42,108 --> 02:20:44,804
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1889
02:20:44,877 --> 02:20:47,812
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

1890
02:20:49,849 --> 02:20:52,215
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.

1891
02:20:53,285 --> 02:20:55,617
What's going on?

1892
02:20:55,688 --> 02:20:59,146
- Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.
- Shoot him in the face!

1893
02:20:59,225 --> 02:21:02,956
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.

1894
02:21:03,029 --> 02:21:06,430
- If you don't take your hand off that case,
it'll be your last. - Stop causing problems!

1895
02:21:06,499 --> 02:21:09,297
You'll get us all killed! Give 'em
what you got and get 'em outta here!

1896
02:21:09,368 --> 02:21:13,600
Shut the fuck up, fat man! This ain't
none of your goddamn business!

1897
02:21:13,673 --> 02:21:15,903
Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.

1898
02:21:15,975 --> 02:21:18,068
No problem.
I got it under control.

1899
02:21:19,645 --> 02:21:21,636
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1900
02:21:23,249 --> 02:21:27,185
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1901
02:21:31,590 --> 02:21:33,524
We clear?

1902
02:21:36,662 --> 02:21:38,596
One.

1903
02:21:40,433 --> 02:21:42,958
Two.

1904
02:21:43,035 --> 02:21:45,094
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

1905
02:21:45,171 --> 02:21:47,230
You win.

1906
02:21:47,306 --> 02:21:49,240
It's yours.

1907
02:21:53,279 --> 02:21:56,009
Open it.

1908
02:21:59,885 --> 02:22:02,115
Hey, what is it?

1909
02:22:02,188 --> 02:22:04,520
What is it?

1910
02:22:04,590 --> 02:22:07,184
Is that what I think it is?

1911
02:22:07,259 --> 02:22:09,955
Mm-hmm.

1912
02:22:11,530 --> 02:22:13,657
It's beautiful.

1913
02:22:13,733 --> 02:22:16,293
Goddamn it, what is it?

1914
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:20,705
You let him go!
You let him go!

1915
02:22:20,773 --> 02:22:23,742
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

1916
02:22:23,809 --> 02:22:26,744
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!" Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool! Be cool!

1917
02:22:26,812 --> 02:22:29,542
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

1918
02:22:29,615 --> 02:22:32,516
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1919
02:22:32,585 --> 02:22:34,382
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1920
02:22:34,453 --> 02:22:37,388
- Now, promise her it's gonna be all right!
- I promise!

1921
02:22:37,456 --> 02:22:39,356
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1922
02:22:39,425 --> 02:22:41,359
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

1923
02:22:41,427 --> 02:22:44,863
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

1924
02:22:44,930 --> 02:22:47,865
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

1925
02:22:47,933 --> 02:22:51,425
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

1926
02:22:51,504 --> 02:22:55,167
- Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?
- He's cool.

1927
02:22:55,241 --> 02:22:57,175
- What?
- Cool.

1928
02:22:57,243 --> 02:23:00,076
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

1929
02:23:00,146 --> 02:23:02,080
We're gonna be cool.

1930
02:23:02,148 --> 02:23:07,051
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

1931
02:23:07,119 --> 02:23:09,212
And when I count three,

1932
02:23:09,288 --> 02:23:12,223
I want you to
let go of your gun,

1933
02:23:12,291 --> 02:23:15,749
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

1934
02:23:16,829 --> 02:23:18,888
And when you do it,

1935
02:23:18,964 --> 02:23:21,023
you do it cool.

1936
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:23,432
You ready?

1937
02:23:23,502 --> 02:23:25,595
One,

1938
02:23:25,671 --> 02:23:27,866
two,

1939
02:23:27,940 --> 02:23:29,874
three.

1940
02:23:36,849 --> 02:23:39,977
- Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

1941
02:23:40,052 --> 02:23:43,647
I thought you were gonna be cool.
Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

1942
02:23:43,722 --> 02:23:45,815
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

1943
02:23:45,891 --> 02:23:49,725
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

1944
02:23:51,363 --> 02:23:54,992
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

1945
02:23:55,067 --> 02:23:58,468
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

1946
02:23:58,537 --> 02:24:00,471
But I don't want that.

1947
02:24:00,539 --> 02:24:02,473
And you don't want that.

1948
02:24:02,541 --> 02:24:05,271
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

1949
02:24:05,344 --> 02:24:07,437
So let's see what we can do.

1950
02:24:09,849 --> 02:24:13,080
Now... here's the situation.

1951
02:24:13,152 --> 02:24:17,020
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

1952
02:24:17,089 --> 02:24:20,525
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

1953
02:24:20,593 --> 02:24:23,528
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

1954
02:24:23,596 --> 02:24:27,532
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

1955
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:30,535
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

1956
02:24:30,603 --> 02:24:33,538
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

1957
02:24:33,606 --> 02:24:35,471
Vincent!

1958
02:24:35,541 --> 02:24:38,476
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!

1959
02:24:38,544 --> 02:24:41,240
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

1960
02:24:41,313 --> 02:24:45,477
Come on. Point the gun at me. Point the gun at me.
There you go. -

1961
02:24:45,551 --> 02:24:47,610
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

1962
02:24:47,686 --> 02:24:49,620
and don't do
a goddamn thing.

1963
02:24:49,688 --> 02:24:51,622
Tell her it's still cool.

1964
02:24:51,690 --> 02:24:54,625
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

1965
02:24:56,028 --> 02:24:58,690
I-- I gotta go pee.

1966
02:24:58,764 --> 02:25:00,698
I wanna go home.

1967
02:25:00,766 --> 02:25:04,361
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

1968
02:25:04,436 --> 02:25:07,371
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

1969
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:10,806
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

1970
02:25:10,876 --> 02:25:14,039
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

1971
02:25:14,113 --> 02:25:18,049
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

1972
02:25:20,586 --> 02:25:24,522
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says "Bad Motherfucker."

1973
02:25:38,783 --> 02:25:41,343
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

1974
02:25:41,419 --> 02:25:44,513
Open it up.
Take out the money.

1975
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:51,721
Count it.

1976
02:25:58,035 --> 02:26:00,560
How much is there?

1977
02:26:02,473 --> 02:26:04,407
About 1,500 dollars.

1978
02:26:04,475 --> 02:26:07,672
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

1979
02:26:07,745 --> 02:26:10,942
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

1980
02:26:11,015 --> 02:26:13,108
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

1981
02:26:13,184 --> 02:26:17,086
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars,
and I'll shoot him on general principle.

1982
02:26:17,155 --> 02:26:20,591
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

1983
02:26:20,658 --> 02:26:22,751
Vince, shut the fuck up!

1984
02:26:22,827 --> 02:26:26,695
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

1985
02:26:26,764 --> 02:26:29,699
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

1986
02:26:29,767 --> 02:26:31,701
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

1987
02:26:32,937 --> 02:26:36,134
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
- What?

1988
02:26:36,207 --> 02:26:40,940
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

1989
02:26:41,012 --> 02:26:43,708
You read the Bible, Ringo?

1990
02:26:44,782 --> 02:26:46,716
Not regularly, no.

1991
02:26:46,784 --> 02:26:49,218
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

1992
02:26:49,287 --> 02:26:52,814
Ezekiel 25:17.

1993
02:26:52,890 --> 02:26:55,723
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

1994
02:26:55,793 --> 02:26:57,727
by the inequities
of the selfish...

1995
02:26:57,795 --> 02:26:59,729
and the tyranny of evil men.

1996
02:26:59,797 --> 02:27:03,164
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

1997
02:27:03,234 --> 02:27:05,668
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

1998
02:27:05,736 --> 02:27:09,832
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

1999
02:27:09,907 --> 02:27:14,207
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2000
02:27:14,278 --> 02:27:17,338
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2001
02:27:17,415 --> 02:27:20,441
And you will know
I am the Lord...

2002
02:27:20,518 --> 02:27:24,079
when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2003
02:27:25,156 --> 02:27:27,590
I been sayin' that shit for years,

2004
02:27:27,658 --> 02:27:30,821
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2005
02:27:30,895 --> 02:27:33,830
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2006
02:27:33,898 --> 02:27:36,833
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2007
02:27:36,901 --> 02:27:39,335
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2008
02:27:39,403 --> 02:27:42,839
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2009
02:27:42,907 --> 02:27:45,842
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2010
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:50,779
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2011
02:27:50,848 --> 02:27:53,783
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2012
02:27:53,851 --> 02:27:57,412
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2013
02:27:57,488 --> 02:27:59,422
Or it could mean...

2014
02:27:59,490 --> 02:28:02,926
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2015
02:28:02,994 --> 02:28:06,930
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2016
02:28:06,998 --> 02:28:09,262
Now, I'd like that.

2017
02:28:09,333 --> 02:28:12,234
But that shit
ain't the truth.

2018
02:28:12,303 --> 02:28:14,168
The truth is,

2019
02:28:15,239 --> 02:28:17,173
you're the weak...

2020
02:28:18,576 --> 02:28:21,977
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

2021
02:28:23,381 --> 02:28:25,315
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2022
02:28:26,584 --> 02:28:29,519
I'm tryin' real hard...

2023
02:28:29,587 --> 02:28:31,851
to be the shepherd.

2024
02:28:47,171 --> 02:28:49,105
Go.

2025
02:29:06,791 --> 02:29:09,225
I think we should be
leaving now.

2026
02:29:09,293 --> 02:29:12,228
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
